        - Not able to focus to listen to life yet
        - Not know how to involve deeply with life yet
        - Still have disturbances that making me react into and not able to pause yet
    - Some reflections
        - I start to see that MY LIFE and MY WAY start to be more detach and not that important that need to be protect and be right. But rather everything is right, and the "mine" is just a tiny small part to serve this so big life that taking place.
        - I start to learn to involve in relationship in a deeper way, and let it take whatever it take that still hold me back.
        - I start to see the inspire to create ways or environments to bring people up rather than down, in rather than out. Because I don't see much in my life now, mostly the inputs brings me down rather than up, out rather than in. I will watch more about this.
        - I start to see the distinction between what I could contribute to life that unique by my strengths.
