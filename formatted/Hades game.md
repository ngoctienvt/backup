- Hades is a [dungeon crawler](<dungeon crawler.md>) game  in which you defy the god of the dead as you hack and slash your way out of the Underworld of Greek myth. 
- My intention for playing this game is
    - To reflect and complete [ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach](<ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach.md>) as [a way to effective mastery](<a way to effective mastery.md>) in a smaller picture.
    - To learn to enjoy the process and release the attachment for trying to be effective and rush through things. [enjoy the process](<enjoy the process.md>)
- In this game, I will have multiple pre-choices from
    - weapons 
        - range or melee
        - fast or slow
        - splash or narrow
    - deepsakes can change in the middle of a game after a boss stage
    - permanent upgrades from mirror
- and tactic-choices when playing the dungeon from
    - Daedalus hammers
    - [Boons](<Boons.md>)
    - Centaur heart
        - getting more hp
    - Pom of powers
        - upgrading the power of boons but usually not much
    - Charon's obol
        - money to get new boons or utilities
    - resources for long-term upgrades
