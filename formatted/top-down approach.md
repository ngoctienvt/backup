- The role of [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>) is
    - aligns, clarify and optimize the things that emerge from [bottom-up approach](<bottom-up approach.md>)
    - 
- Benefits:
    - helps to understand thing in a deeper level and honor the moment.
    - clarify direction
    - space for nurture and develop things 
- Components
    - Identify [personal end goals](<personal end goals.md>)
    - Seeing big picture or the direction [big picture thinking](<big picture thinking.md>)
    - [soft-boundary](<soft-boundary.md>) - not meant for defining what's right or what's wrong, but for 
        - act with confident, clarity and reduce [inner conflict](<inner conflict.md>)
        - [Map of Contents](<Map of Contents.md>) [bottom-line](<bottom-line.md>)
        - The boundary need to be clear about what is okay to be keep open and what is not.
            - What is okay?
                - add-on information - are information that will be accumulated and condensed and restructred if it started to excess number 5.
                - [direct-related connections](<direct-related connections.md>) are the connection that directly relate to its [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>). The [direct-related connections](<direct-related connections.md>) can also become the [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>) of other smaller connections
                    - The highest atomic thing would be me. [trueself](<trueself.md>) Anything else is just my relationship with them.
                - Limited direct connection - temporary maximum 5.
                    - When there are more than 5 connections, it's a good time to condense these things and organize them in a hierarchy way. So that's making sure there is only 5 [direct-related connections](<direct-related connections.md>) for the [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>).
            - What is not okay?
                - Too many direct connections
                - Try to link to different context - should be focus on 1 thing only
    - [external knowledge](<external knowledge.md>) for effective learning
