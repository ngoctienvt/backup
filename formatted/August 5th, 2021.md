- I gradually have been deepen insights about my own inner experiences as well as about how evolution taking place. [soul evolution](<soul evolution.md>)
    - I realize that there is still some involuntary resistance inside of me that act like a brake of a bike to prevent me to keep the flow happen by itself. 
        - It's somehow about the disturbances, the fear of unknown, the unwillingness to embrace the difficult to handle vibrations of reality.
        - And I will need to work more on this to develop more faith, less resistance, less need to control, but rather trust the flow, and let myself into the flow, go with the flow instead.
    - I also realize that there's nothing wrong with anyone. Yet their growth maybe not happen directly like me, but it will happen eventually. There is no need to force for it. Of course it's better to support the process instead of totally passive. 
        - The evolution is all about deepening insights and raising consciousness or returning to the source, and become more awaken and more evolve to different vibrations of life.
            - It's about learning to unattachment and remain awake, aware, and tune in to the truth. The insights will help us to release the ignorant and able to live the truth gradually.
    - I am learning to be flow more with life, like the free coaching taking place that stimulate my inner resistance. And it's a good opportunity for me to learn to surrender even more.
    - I also realize that when we able to keep the flow of energy happen smoothly, it will always generate new joy and never become old.
