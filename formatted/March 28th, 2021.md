    - Some of the characteristics of the process to help other people create and embrace new attitude
        - Self-select
        - Self-realization -> self-reorganization -> self-creation -> self-select -> self-monitoring/ self-internalization
        - Challenge the old self-concept and create the new self-concept that will act as a bridge to no-self

            - The middle path and the pathless path

            - Fearless and desireless, but expression the divinity
        - Choiceless, surender and participate instead
            - Tròn vai
            - Totality participating in the moment, not desire satisfaction
        - The guest, the gamer, not the game character - center on the seat of awareness, not identification for what's not the self
            - Unattachment and no possession, just borrow and distribution
        - Surrender to the wonder of life - allow it to be the way it is
- I felt so much more free today. I still may make mistakes, make uncomfortable feelings for other people, but I will take responsibilities for my actions. I will learn from the law of cause and effect. I will make my best each moment and allow myself to be wrong, to be fail, to be hate, because the school of life is meant to teach us, not to fear about the consequences. 
    - As long as I grow and become better over time, there are no wrong or failures, only lessons and mature.

    - This morning, I learnt a big lesson that the mind can make up everything the way it can think of. But it's unrelevant to the reality. The absolute truth is on the reality, not what the mind can think about.
        - I don't have to live on the mind or the disturb heart. But rather stay center, and experiences everything to the fullest, no matter how hard it is.
        - What's important is not what happen, but can  I handle and embrace it, so that it will pass and let me left unmark.
