- When we feel most stuck and helpless, it’s because we’ve bought into the idea that our choices, and choices alone, determine the outcomes of our lives.

- I noticed that I need to establish a new way of looking life. It's not that there is time I work, other time I don't work. The fact is I always do something, this is a [continuous process](<continuous process.md>) with no stop at all. I just transition from one work to another work, from an intentional work to unconscious work. Once I still not aware and work fully on my unconscious work, I still will be trying non-stop to overcome that unconscious instead of working on it to direct myself fully to the flow that I want to live with.

## [my quotes](<my quotes.md>)
- If we look outside, we see problems. If we look inside, we see the part we're unable to handle yet. [seeing the truth of the world](<seeing the truth of the world.md>)
