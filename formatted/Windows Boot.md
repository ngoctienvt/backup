- Windows has two kinds of boot: UEFI and Legacy. My Dell laptop is UEFI and I don't truly understand how to reinstall or ghost my windows. It's not really [mental squeeze point](<mental squeeze point.md>) yet, because I wouldn't do it many times now. So for things happen sometimes only, and the price is not much, I think I will use external support if it's kind of complicated. [Windows Boot](<Windows Boot.md>)
