- I noticed that I have a fear that people will ruin the envionment around me or the things that I possess.
    - My mind start to imaginate and create every possible worst outcomes that I don't want to face. I want to release all of these unnecessary imaginations, while also let my mind feel secure that I will take responsibilities for things happen around me.
    - We will learn to take responsibilities for what happens in front of us and grow together. At least it's better than ruin our life when things that haven't even happened yet. Let me enjoy the time that challenging situations haven't actually occured.
    - And not do anything unnecessary based on the fear and imaginations, but rather nurture courage, responsibilities, and faith instead.
    - I also need to learn to detach completely with the mind, its imaginations, projections, so that I could absolutely interact with reality in a way that's not relative, but rather how can I said? Flow with it instead, and not even have a bit of intention to control, hold, grab it.
        - Let it comes and let it goes, that's it. Flow with it. Make sure that catch the flow.

    - Highlights:
        - I start to do a free coaching project that have no idea how it will turn out. But at least, I will do my best to let go of the inner stuffs, so that I can become more freedom, feel more comfortable with new people, less judgements, more curiousity, less fear, more faith. So that I can support them as best as I can.
        - I start to learn to act accordingly with the inner flow of energy in a way that it maintains the flow of energy that freely flow without any supressions, resistances, or wrong directions.
        - The inner landscape is becoming more and more quiet day by day. More fears come up and come out. More needs be address and resolve internally.
        - Learning to embrace life, and less care about convenience, but rather something different instead. Care about life, about people, about reality, about the flow of life and the harmony between me and life.
        - I just started to realize that I'm not good at listening to life. This will the central lessons that I will learn next.
        - For the group coaching program or about collective growth, I'm gradually develop a way or a system that will make sure things evolve by the internal forces and reflections of all people together. Instead of a people think what would be best, but rather help people to utilize life as their best teacher.
