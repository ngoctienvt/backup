- [üìùWeekly Review](<üìùWeekly Review.md>)
    - Highlights:
        - I realize that I am on the journey of letting go of myself and learning to participate with the dance of life
        - I am learning to remain center and conscious as a witness conscious and not be identify with the other thing.
        - I am learning to love other people by expanding the inner love energy into them and purify judgement and disturbances related to other people.
    - Reflection
        - I notice that I start to less do inner work and start to serve the world through the expression of inner energy
        - I start to have the courage to live the world without the need to try to make it knowable so that I will be less fear and afraid of it.
            - It's actually the fear when identify the sense of self to the body, the game character, the mind...
            - It's about not feeling fear of whatever will come to me, but trust and grateful instead. Because experiences are the highest food for me.
        - It's important to untie the witness conscious and remain center and unattachment
        - There are still the urge of fix inside through the sense of experience with boardgame and the need to share the joy with other people.
            - It is also the need to do something rather than just being and enjoy
        - My body is easy to tired and need to improve the capacity of it to become a more well-being state.
