- I felt that some big samskaras that come up and I truly lost with them. At least the good thing is I still remember some big things to relax and release, so that I could come back to my [seat of consciousness](<seat of consciousness.md>).
- Yesterday learning and teaching about the [Session 7 - Learning to let go](<Session 7 - Learning to let go.md>) that really help me to understand deeper about the spiritual path.
    - Meditation is mainly to practice [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>) so that I could present and do my work, instead of letting my samskaras and my [habit-formed will](<habit-formed will.md>) control me.
    - [lower-hanging fruit](<lower-hanging fruit.md>) is the samskaras that after we let go, there is nothing left to deal with.
    - [higher-hanging fruit](<higher-hanging fruit.md>) is the samskaras that after we let go, we still need to learn to interact properly with the unfolding moments.
    - For [living from the place of surrender](<living from the place of surrender.md>), it is 24/7, 
        - the first part is always about [letting go](<letting go.md>)
            - Either samskaras are emerged by themselves, or triggered by the unfolding moments, our job is take time to relax and release. This is about handling the accumulated stuff. [mature samskaras](<mature samskaras.md>)
            - Second is not putting more stuff everyday, because one small samskara can be a source to accumulate many other samskara. [immature samskaras](<immature samskaras.md>)
        - the second part is learning to [serving the demand of reality](<serving the demand of reality.md>)
    - The most important thing is not about [understanding the truth](<understanding the truth.md>), it is about the [desire](<desire.md>) to live the truth itself. Without the willingness, everything is just like water off a duck's back. And the soul will asleep in the sea of samskaras. [desire to live the higher life](<desire to live the higher life.md>)
- I also noticed that I have a big expectation for people to truly awake and truly consider what they want to do with their life. Even though this expectation is good, but it's not really what I want. Because I don't want to put my pressure or expectation into other people, instead of that, I just want to support and empower them, so that they could awake and make their own choice. [tough love](<tough love.md>) [unattachment empowering](<unattachment empowering.md>) 
- This week my major samskaras related to my need for protecting what's important to me. [need for protection](<need for protection.md>) It's a big thing that related to my Tiến's principle sub-personality that it based on what I trust on what's the right thing. And I need to let go these needs and embrace the what's truly the right thing. [seeing the truth of the world](<seeing the truth of the world.md>)
