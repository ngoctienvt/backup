- Characteristics of atomic concept
    - only about one thing 
    - capture the entirety of that thing. [entirety of an atomic concept](<entirety of an atomic concept.md>)
    - densely connected
- The fundamental building blocks of [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>) are [information block](<information block.md>)

- For how I store information, I will focus on storing them as [high-value information blocks](<high-value information blocks.md>) that not too broad, but not too narrow at the same time. They said that it should be [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>)

- [direct-related connections](<direct-related connections.md>) are the connection that directly relate to its [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>).

- [direct-related connections](<direct-related connections.md>) are the connection that directly relate to its [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>). The [direct-related connections](<direct-related connections.md>) can also become the [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>)

- When there are more than 5 connections, it's a good time to condense these things and organize them in a hierarchy way. So that's making sure there is only 5 [direct-related connections](<direct-related connections.md>) for the [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>).
