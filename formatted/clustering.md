## [October 21st, 2020](<October 21st, 2020.md>)
- for collecting raw materials, I feel that it's very important to keep it in a way that I can easily come back to what I haven't resolved yet. My current method is using Resources to keep track of things. But I have the worry when it will become clustering when there are more things. [clustering](<clustering.md>)

## [clean up fleeting notes](<clean up fleeting notes.md>)
- I worry if my Roam Research becomes cluster and I need to reread too many notes, even the one that got used instead of just working on the new things that I haven't resolved. [clustering](<clustering.md>)

## [positive inner feedback loop](<positive inner feedback loop.md>)
- When the trees are gathered enough, we will start developing a need to condense them naturally, because we will feel that they are clustering and need to resolve when the materials are ready. [clustering](<clustering.md>)
