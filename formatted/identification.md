- I still have some parts inside of me have problems with [fairness](<fairness.md>), [identification](<identification.md>)

- Whatever the [consciousness](<consciousness.md>) [identify](<identify.md>) it with, the consciousness acquires the characteristic of what its identified with. If you identify with fear, you feel fear. If you identify with the breath, you feel neutral. If you identify with love, you feel love.

I want to work from the soul level down to the human being level. The reason is if I operate on a human being level, I'm very easy to lose myself in the thinking level that derives from [identification](<identification.md>)

## [surrender](<surrender.md>)
- We are not willing to surrender because of our ignorance and the fact that we lost in the [identification](<identification.md>)
