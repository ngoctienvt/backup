- Last night, I dreamt about dating with [@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh](<@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh.md>), I will learn to release these needs so that I could be completely neutral about her instead of having personal desire.
    - If I have feeling, it is unattachment feeling that want to raise her up.
- I felt uncomfortable and judge my teammates as a burden when they don't active as I expect. I felt that it's better to do alone instead of having to chase them. But actually, I realize that I need to be my best part first. When I'm doing my part, it will help them to engage the process easier. [judgment](<judgment.md>)
- I felt that I'm becoming freer and grow much faster recently. I don't just good as processing my internal things, I'm also becoming to learn new things much faster based on my PKDS system and my knowledge about expertise. [outgrowth](<outgrowth.md>)
- Today I taught [@Dương Thị Huyền](<@Dương Thị Huyền.md>) about few things related to end goals and expertise. It's good that from new way of interacting, she is much more engage and create much more results rather than I'm just simply saying to her the requirements or what she should do, and let she figure it out by herself.
- I also notice that I will need to merge my [personal end goals](<personal end goals.md>) with what I want to do and align them properly, so that's my focus will be sharp and clear. [convergence focus](<convergence focus.md>)
