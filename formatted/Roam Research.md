- Roam Research philosophy: bottom-up your thinking by imitating how your brain works. 
- Pros: 
    - Replacing what's your brain do ineffective so you can focus on what's your actual brain should spend [energy](<energy.md>) on.
        - Works as a stored node information
        - Able to recall exactly all bits of link information and find back unlink information as well.
- Roam Research's function
    -  Primary function:
        - A tool for [PC-mind upgrading](<PC-mind upgrading.md>)
    - Secondary function:
        - [information storehouse](<information storehouse.md>) 
        - [todo list](<todo list.md>) - task management
        - [calendar](<calendar.md>) - meeting/ schedule management

    - [2. Quick Capture](<2. Quick Capture.md>): 
- Roam Research can store the information of each star floating in the universe. It is created with nearly no energy needed. It's also able to [extract and gather information](<extract and gather information.md>) of the stars and those related to it quickly. The data also get maintain physically, so the mind or the inner universe no need energy to retain it.
- The universe now can use its energy mainly for [compressed process](<compressed process.md>) and this is what speeds up the evolution of the universe to become a more advancing universe.
- Summary:
    - Using external support to release the [inner flow of energy](<inner flow of energy.md>) for ineffective activities.
    - The free up energy can now be use for creative and productive activities [compressed process](<compressed process.md>)
    - This speeds up the [mind evolution process](<mind evolution process.md>)In this process, the [inner blockages](<inner blockages.md>) will get release or die off and release back the energy took to maintain it. It helps the soul evolve which is the one who behind th
    - In this process, the [inner blockages](<inner blockages.md>) will get released or died off and release back the energy took to maintain it. It helps the soul evolve, which is the one behind the universe, and returns the energy to its source. So it brought back the power using for [personal mind](<personal mind.md>) to return it to [intellectual mind](<intellectual mind.md>).

- First I will analyze how [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>)

- First, many apps are very good at working as an [information storehouse](<information storehouse.md>) like Evernote or Notion. However, this works in a hierarchy structure that didn't keep a concept or idea as a node that inter-related, but rather separating them into different categorizations with multiple concepts. [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>)

- My main point here is Roam Research helped me to realize that in order to evolve my mind, it's best to works from the bottom-up approach continuously. As my mind evolve, the system will evolve itself. I don't need to learn too much beforehand, and I just need to focus on where I am, and bottom-up from that. If I need anything else, I just change them from the new stars and leave the old star died off. The structure-less of [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>)
