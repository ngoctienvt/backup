    - The idea of creating Structure Coaching activities for participants to support each other seems interesting. It's not easy to instruct and execute though, but I think there will be a way to do this properly, especially in the long run class, because people will have opportunities to improve.
    - Some initial ideas is a person will share their stories, and each person will be instruct to do a different competencies in coaching.
        - Like a person will do a direct communication to make a comment, share an observation, share a point of view, and following up with a simple question.
        - Or a person will do powerful questions to ask questions that provoke the person thinking or challenge their beliefs.
    - There will be some rules or principles to help people facilitate the process properly like
        - Keep silence after the question and let the coachee announce
        - Make sure that you own your observations, and make sure that the questions are helpful for the coachee rather than satisfy your own curiosity.
    - Or there will be a reflection activities to sum up what has been discuss and next step for further exploration
