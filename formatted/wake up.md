## [September 16th, 2020](<September 16th, 2020.md>)
- Recently I woke up quite fast, because I realized the thought or the dream that I identified with much easier, so I can choose to withdraw out of it. However, I still feel lazy to get out of my bed, because I still feel that I want to sleep a bit more, since my body got cold and I want to relax and release accumulated stress on my body first.
