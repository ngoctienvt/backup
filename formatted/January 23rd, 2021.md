- I feel that my presence is much better recently. I feel much more empty and stillness in my heart. I feel much more calm, less disturb and inner thoughts. Though I'm not feel high yet, but it's a good sign.
- I also start to slowly bottom up my expertise from the area I care about and want to develop myself into. I noticed that [üå±Choiceless Awareness](<üå±Choiceless Awareness.md>) is about merging and letting things unfold naturally without the different forces that pull me into different directions. They are handled and merged into each other to become oneness instead.
    - Without expectations or preferences, there are only one choice.
- [üìùCoaching Review](<üìùCoaching Review.md>) I noticed that I can presence much better today, and listen with much more clarity and deeper without personal agenda or personal interests. It helps me to care more about clients and their concerns. From this point, techniques are not important anymore, because even if I don't know the techniques, I still know what I need to focus on and clarify it.
