- I feel that I start to learn about how I can have the ability to offer [true love](<true love.md>) for myself, for other, and for reality.
    - Capacity to generate happiness for myself and for others
    - Capcity to remove suffer for myself and for others
    - Capacity to offer joy for myself and for others
    - Capacity to offer freedom for myself and for others
    - It will take time to learn this, but as long as I practice to able to offer for myself first, then slowly I expand to include other people but not breaking the principles, I will grow and become a better lover.
        - Conditional or unconditional is not important, the important is to do the right things with the right attitude. These principles will act as guidelines for me to improve, rather than focus on the label to proud or not.
