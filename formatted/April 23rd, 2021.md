- Last night I still have many dreams worry about things, stuffs that I own and the fear that I have to use money to fix them.
    - This is a way of thinking that's dangerous, because I will never peace completely. There is a need to shift my thinking into I own nothing, they are just distribute to me for the time being. If they need to change, at that time, I will be distributed another thing. If they need to leave, I will just let it leave. There is no need to attach and fear, because the universe is always on my side.
        - It will always take care of me no matter what. My job is not about worry how things will be distributed. My job is about how to live fully in each moment, rather than worrying about the future.
- When I heard Michael Singer talk about focus on what's work, it is what I learn to shift myself into. But work based on what?
    - There are few things that I seem to be care about
        - One is about inner happiness. I want to focus on what's work to bring me the true inner happiness, the juice of joy, the state of being high inside unconditionally.
            - This will require me to free myself out of the mind, handle the past samskaras, let go the self-concept, learning to self-navigation
        - Second is about interaction with reality. I want the interaction is meaningful for me and for other. I want it happens in a way that things become more and more simple, rather than become more and more complex.
            - I mean I want to enjoy my life at first. In order for this to happen, I will need to find inner happiness first. This will help me to complete at least 50% of this want.
                - Then I want to bring true joy, true growth, true happiness for people around me. Because this will bring me more joy.
