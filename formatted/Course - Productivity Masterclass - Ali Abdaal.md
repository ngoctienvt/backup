    - Productivity = (Useful or Meaningful Output)/ Time * fun factor
        - Aspect that could be [targeted intervention](<targeted intervention.md>)
        - Productive about the right thing [on the right track](<on the right track.md>)
    - Mental model about productivity [productivity mental model](<productivity mental model.md>)
        - Pilot - 10% - clarity - **Useful** [intention](<intention.md>)
            - Set the course of the plane
            - Figure out what direction the plane is heading in
            - Gives the instruction to the plane
        - Plane - 80% - **Output** [execution](<execution.md>)
            - Follow the course, not deviate
            - Take off efficiently, land safely
        - The engineer - 5-10% - **Time** [maintenance](<maintenance.md>)
            - Make sure the plane is efficient
            - Fuel efficient
            - Keep the system organized 
    - Reflective question
        - Which do I struggle most of all? In what specific way? 
            - I struggle with most of them [personal challenges](<personal challenges.md>)
                - For the pilot, I struggle to set the long destination, and break down to small milestones that ensure to keep me on the right direction.
                - For the plane, I'm not comfortable to work on the long period of time, and sometimes I'm just kind of working in a circle or let things emerge appear by themselves, but not actually fully active working on this.
                - For the engineer, I'm just starting to build my system, before that, I just keep myself at least on the not breakdown level and too much stress.
- ### ["I don't have time" myth](<"I don't have time" myth.md>)
    - Time is what we want most, but what we use worst - William Penn [efficient](<efficient.md>)
        - We always choose to do something, and not do something. 
            - It's not we don't have time, it's not our priority
            - It's not the case limited by time, it's a case that limited by the choices that we make with our time.
    - From "I don't have time" to "I'm choosing not to make the time".  
        - Train our brain not to say "Sorry I don't have time" but "I have other priority things to do..."
        - Tips
            - Write down exactly what you are doing with your time - tracking it to get in touch with the reality
    - Reflective question
        - What is the reason for me using the phrase I don't have time?
            - I don't feel meaning on that - small talk, listening other people problem without seeing their intention to resolve it
            - I feel tired and I want to rest
            - I'm not interested on that
        - Optional action - tracking your time on 1 week
- ### [motivation myth](<motivation myth.md>)
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FNgoctien%2F2G_MQglYWD.png?alt=media&token=ad06b972-c4e4-43b8-86fa-6b3bb9778572)
    - We think we had to have the feeling of doing something to do something. [false belief](<false belief.md>)
        - Relying on our feelings to work is a receipt for disaster, because it's not reliable. [solid foundation](<solid foundation.md>)
            - It's about the true self choose to do something, not about give up our free-will to our heart.  [freewill](<freewill.md>)
    - The outcome is usually long time on the future, we don't have an immeditate feedback. [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>) continuously
        - Make the action [samskaras-based solution](<samskaras-based solution.md>)
            - more pleasurable 
                - (game, friendly competition like boardgame, process goal, environment. music...)
            - consequences of inaction more painful. 
                - It's kind of trigger the pain samskaras.
                - Deadline, pre-paid money, beeminder, 
        - Make the outcome [inner clarity](<inner clarity.md>)
            - short-term [built-in feedback loop](<built-in feedback loop.md>)
                - example of feedback loops, game, sports,...
            - making the outcome more salient, more clear [inner clarity](<inner clarity.md>)
    - The ideal is we don't need motivation in the first place, but rather nurture our will-power to overcome these habit-formed will and transform them into our desired habit pattern  instead. [willpower](<willpower.md>)
        - You don't need the motivation to go to work or to go to school to do exam.
    - Reflective thinking
        - The most important thing I learn is I don't have to give my right to my feelings and my thoughts, I need to learn to become the one who direct my life, so that they become my servant instead.
        - [samskaras-based solution](<samskaras-based solution.md>) is helpful for short-term, but for long-term, it's better to let go of the inner blockages and build up the [conscious will](<conscious will.md>) instead.
        - It's very important to build ourselves based on a [solid foundation](<solid foundation.md>) which usually based on truth, reality or the natural flow of inner energy, instead of our feelings and our thoughts. 
- [multi-tasking myth](<multi-tasking myth.md>)
    - Do work at the same time create the feeling of productive, but not actually. [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>)
    - [flow state](<flow state.md>) is an optimal consciousness state that we can completely focused on one thing.
        - put ourselves on [stretch zone](<stretch zone.md>) so that we can focused on it 
        - absence of distractions
            - internal
            - external
    - Reflective questions
        - What's situation when I was in my 'flow state'?
        - What's circumstances and mindsets led to that?
        - How can I create the optimal conditions to let me in that state?
