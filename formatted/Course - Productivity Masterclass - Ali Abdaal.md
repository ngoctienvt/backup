    - Targeted interventions
    - Productivity = (Useful or Meaningful Output)/ Time * fun factor
        - Productive about the right thing
    - Mental model about productivity
        - Pilot - 10% - clarity - **Useful**
            - Set the course of the plane
            - Figure out what direction the plane is heading in
            - Gives the instruction to the plane
        - Plane - 80% - **Output**
            - Follow the course, not deviate
            - Take off efficiently, land safely
        - The engineer - 5-10% - **Time**
            - Make sure the plane is efficient
            - Fuel efficient
            - Keep the system organized 
    - Reflective question
        - Which do I struggle most of all? In what specific way?
            - I struggle with most of them
                - For the pilot, I struggle to set the long destination, and break down to small milestones that ensure to keep me on the right direction.
                - For the plane, I'm not comfortable to work on the long period of time, and sometimes I'm just kind of working in a circle or let things emerge appear by themselves, but not actually fully active working on this.
                - For the engineer, I'm just starting to build my system, before that, I just keep myself at least on the not breakdown level and too much stress.
- ### The myth of "I don't have time"
    - Time is what we want most, but what we use worst - William Penn
    - We always choose to do something, and not do something.
    - It's not we don't have time, it's not our priority
    - It's not the case limited by time, it's a case that limited by the choices that we make with our time.
    - From "I don't have time" to "I'm choosing not to make the time".
    - Train our brain not to say "Sorry I don't have time" but "I have other priority things to do..."
    - Tips
        - Write down exactly what you are doing with your time - tracking it
    - Reflective question
        - What is the reason for me using the phrase I don't have time?
            - I don't feel meaning on that - small talk, listening other people problem without seeing their intention to resolve it
            - I feel tired and I want to rest
            - I'm not interested on that
        - Optional action - tracking your time on 1 week
- ### The myth of motivation
    - We think we had to have the feeling of doing something to do something.
    - Relying on our feelings to work is a receipt for disaster, because it's not reliable.
    - It's about the true self choose to do something, not about depend on our heart to allow us to do things we want.
    - The outcome is usually long time on the future, we don't have an immeditate feedback. 
    - Make the action is more pleasurable
