    - Productivity = (Useful or Meaningful Output)/ Time * fun factor
        - Aspect that could be [targeted intervention](<targeted intervention.md>)
        - Productive about the right thing [on the right track](<on the right track.md>)

            - Set the course of the plane
            - Figure out what direction the plane is heading in
            - Gives the instruction to the plane
        - Plane - 80% - **Output** [execution](<execution.md>)
            - Follow the course, not deviate

    - Reflective question
        - Which do I struggle most of all? In what specific way? 
            - I struggle with most of them [personal challenges](<personal challenges.md>)
                - For the pilot, I struggle to set the long destination, and break down to small milestones that ensure to keep me on the right direction.
                - For the plane, I'm not comfortable to work on the long period of time, and sometimes I'm just kind of working in a circle or let things emerge appear by themselves, but not actually fully active working on this.
                - For the engineer, I'm just starting to build my system, before that, I just keep myself at least on the not breakdown level and too much stress.
- Three productivity myth
    - ### ["I don't have time" myth](<"I don't have time" myth.md>)
        - Time is what we want most, but what we use worst - William Penn [efficient](<efficient.md>)
            - We always choose to do something, and not do something. 
                - It's not we don't have time, it's not our priority
                - It's not the case limited by time, it's a case that limited by the choices that we make with our time.
        - From "I don't have time" to "I'm choosing not to make the time".  
            - Train our brain not to say "Sorry I don't have time" but "I have other priority things to do..."
            - Tips
                - Write down exactly what you are doing with your time - tracking it to get in touch with the reality
        - Reflective question
            - What is the reason for me using the phrase I don't have time?
                - I don't feel meaning on that - small talk, listening other people problem without seeing their intention to resolve it
                - I feel tired and I want to rest
                - I'm not interested on that
            - Optional action - tracking your time on 1 week
    - ### [motivation myth](<motivation myth.md>)
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FNgoctien%2F2G_MQglYWD.png?alt=media&token=ad06b972-c4e4-43b8-86fa-6b3bb9778572)
        - We think we had to have the feeling of doing something to do something. [false belief](<false belief.md>)
            - Relying on our feelings to work is a receipt for disaster, because it's not reliable. [solid foundation](<solid foundation.md>)
                - It's about the true self choose to do something, not about give up our free-will to our heart.  [freewill](<freewill.md>)
        - The outcome is usually long time on the future, we don't have an immeditate feedback. [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>) continuously
            - Make the action [samskaras-based solution](<samskaras-based solution.md>)
                - more pleasurable 
                    - (game, friendly competition like boardgame, process goal, environment. music...)
                - consequences of inaction more painful. 
                    - It's kind of trigger the pain samskaras.
                    - Deadline, pre-paid money, beeminder, 
            - Make the outcome [inner clarity](<inner clarity.md>)
                - short-term [built-in feedback loop](<built-in feedback loop.md>)
                    - example of feedback loops, game, sports,...
                - making the outcome more salient, more clear [inner clarity](<inner clarity.md>)
        - The ideal is we don't need motivation in the first place, but rather nurture our will-power to overcome these habit-formed will and transform them into our desired habit pattern  instead. [willpower](<willpower.md>)
            - You don't need the motivation to go to work or to go to school to do exam.
        - Reflective thinking
            - The most important thing I learn is I don't have to give my right to my feelings and my thoughts, I need to learn to become the one who direct my life, so that they become my servant instead.
            - [samskaras-based solution](<samskaras-based solution.md>) is helpful for short-term, but for long-term, it's better to let go of the inner blockages and build up the [conscious will](<conscious will.md>) instead.
            - It's very important to build ourselves based on a [solid foundation](<solid foundation.md>) which usually based on truth, reality or the natural flow of inner energy, instead of our feelings and our thoughts. 
    - [multi-tasking myth](<multi-tasking myth.md>)
        - Do work at the same time create the feeling of productive, but not actually. [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>)
        - [Flow State MOC](<Flow State MOC.md>) is an optimal consciousness state that we can completely focused on one thing.
            - put ourselves on [stretch zone](<stretch zone.md>) so that we can focused on it 
            - absence of distractions
                - internal
                - external
        - Reflective questions

            - What's circumstances and mindsets led to that?
            - How can I create the optimal conditions to let me in that state?
- 3 laws of productivity
    - [Parkinson's law](<Parkinson's law.md>) [horizons of focus](<horizons of focus.md>)
        - Work expands to fill the time that we allocate to it
            - Having too much time to do something is a recipe for procrastination
        - Application
            - Think about 10 years plan and ask "How can you achieve it within 6 months?" 
            - Giving ourselves artificial deadline - [constraint](<constraint.md>)
                - But our mind knows it is an artificial deadline, so you can make it become a real deadline, like giving money to someone and lost it if you can't complete tasks. [samskaras-based solution](<samskaras-based solution.md>)
        - Reflection

            - What if I have only next 24 hours?
    - [Pareto principle](<Pareto principle.md>) 
        - Pareto principle is [focus on what matters](<focus on what matters.md>)
            - 80% of the result comes from 20% of the effort.
            - 80% of the output comes from 20% of the input...
            - Because what is not matters have significant diminishing returns
        - Application
            - What is your end goal here? And what is 20% that I need to do to achieve it? [end goal](<end goal.md>)
            - Building continual process of 80/20 and whatever is left.  [form-shaping](<form-shaping.md>)
                - Filling the picture is more important than filling the detail.

    - [Newton's first law of motion](<Newton's first law of motion.md>)
        - An object is at rest or travelling at a constant velocity unless it's acted on by an external, imbalanced force.
            - If something is still, stay still. If we stay still, it is require external force.  [willpower](<willpower.md>)
            - If something is moving, it will keep moving forward.  [snowball effect](<snowball effect.md>)
                - It's harder to start something than to continue doing something.
        - Tips
            - 2-minute rule - if something takes less than 2 minutes, do it now rather than todo list
            - 5-minute rule - if we struggle to start with any task,  just do 5 minute of it [snowball effect](<snowball effect.md>)
            - do mindless work, setting up things, reduce friction [reducing friction](<reducing friction.md>)
            - [keystone habit](<keystone habit.md>)- if we do one habit, it will lead to other thing related to it. [narrow direction](<narrow direction.md>)
                - It's like if we going on one path, we will continue to do what happens on that path.
                - For example, if I have habit to stay sitting on my chair instead of my bed, I will tend to other high-value tasks rather than low-value tasks like sleeping.
- The 3 powers of productivity
    - [the power of habit](<the power of habit.md>) or consistency
        - [habit](<habit.md>) are atomic
        - Why?

    - The power of productive procrastination
        - doing something that's inherently useful for bottom-up knowledge like 
            - writing, meditation, watching useful youtube videos, reading high value articles...
        - Reflection
            - reducing friction and [intentional direction](<intentional direction.md>) is very important to build up a life that's progressive moving forward.

            - If we decide what we like and what we won't like, we actually limit and actively make our journey on earth is tough. 
- ## Personal reflection
    - This is a truly good course that give me many insights and provoke thoughtful awareness for me.
    - 80/20 principle and [form-shaping](<form-shaping.md>) are two things that  I want to develop myself to use them properly.
    - [intentional direction](<intentional direction.md>) and [keystone habit](<keystone habit.md>) is also very helpful to help me [snowball](<snowball.md>) by living my life instead of drowing inside
    - [the power of productive downtime](<the power of productive downtime.md>) is also making me thinking about finding quality input for collecting data stage.
