    - Instead of trying to go to the next step, we will naturally move on when the current step are ready for the next step. [readiness](<readiness.md>)
        - For example, [Evergreen garden](<Evergreen garden.md>) 
            - When the trees are gathered enough, we will start developing a need to condense them naturally, because we will feel that they are clustering and need to resolve when the materials are ready.

        - For example, [deeper understanding](<deeper understanding.md>)
            - instead of writing what we are taught without processing, write it in our own word or own understanding can give us feedback to how much we understand
- [built-in feedback loop](<built-in feedback loop.md>)
    - The feedback are built in the process itself instead of an external things
