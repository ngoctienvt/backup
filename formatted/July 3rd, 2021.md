    - For the next part of the group coaching program, I'm not totally clear yet how I want to navigate that
        - From how anh Tuáº¥n do, it's about identify blockages, focus on one main and discuss to find a way out
            - Then discuss about discipline, clarify actions that will need to focus next, make an ecology check and reflect from the program
        - Somehow I found it's also quite okay, but not as impactful as how I expect. In an ideal way, for me it will need to establish at least a way to move forward even meet the blockages and still know how to navigate through it.
            - The focus will also not about the actions and STOP - START - CONTINUE, because it feels disconnect with the source of being. I will want to do it in a way that deeply connect with the source of their being, and from that, they will arrive the next step as a natural process.
            - It's also good to work around the discipline, but in a way that deeper so that people can learn to focus on their journey without being distracted and feeling stuck, but always know how to have a proper to help them on the right track.
            - It's also need to empower, make the clients feel strong, clear, so ready to move forward the challenges that they are meeting.
            - They will also need to learn how to harmony with life so that life will become a best teacher for them, rather than against them.
        - So the last 2 or sessions can be break down into
            - A session about facing challenges and moving forward
                - Participants can build up their strength, courage, feel strong, empower, ready, to move forward.
                - They know how to deal with distractions, stuck, and know how to keep their life in the right direction
            - A session about learning to move with life and change the relationship with life
                - They learn how to make life become their friends, their teachers rather than their enemy
            - A final session about reflection for the whole journey and planning for future
                - They clear about what they will focus and do next for the next stage of life
                -  And also have a clear picture about their life and those influences around them.
        - Some key quality that coaching can bring into these are
            - Natural - deep connection - from inside to outside
            - Focus on the light and expand it
            - Learn to include and see things from a different perspective
            - Nurture the ability to navigate through life
