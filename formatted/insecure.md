- I felt that I have a fear that my house will be rob and insecure. It's making me feel that the world could be a dangerous place to live with. But through the meditation, I noticed that we are all here to learn, and other people need to heal themselves, so that they can act with integrity. And I put my trust to bring the peace, heal, and forgiveness to the space around my home. I wish that everyone do the lower things could listen to their inner wisdom and live a higher life.
