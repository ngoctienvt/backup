- ## Course introduction
    - In 1971, at age 22, Michael moved out into the woods where The Temple of the Universe sits today. **At that time in his life, Michael did not know how to surrender, or even what surrender was.**
    - Using the events in the outside world that were unfolding before him—his relationships, his business interactions, his personal experiences—**Michael eventually learned how to get out of his own way and, ultimately, embrace the art of surrender.** He has now created this online course for you to do the same.
    - After the Course Introduction, we will share some of the specifics related to the design and structure of the course, what you can expect, and our recommendations for how to move through the course.
    - Let’s begin the journey into living a life of surrender.
- ## [Session 1 - Who am I](<Session 1 - Who am I.md>)
- ## [Session 2 - the outside world](<Session 2 - the outside world.md>)
- ## Session 3 - The mind, part 1
    - ### Introduction
        - So far in the course, we have stressed the fact that you are in there experiencing what passes before you. **We discovered that the moment unfolding in front of you took 13.8 billion years to get here, and it is not personal.** You did not create the moment—it was given to you and you alone.** Each moment is a unique gift.**
        - Now we will begin to **explore another thing you are aware of:** **the mind.** As we’ve learned, you are not the mind; you are simply aware of the mind. The **human mind is truly amazing**—it is brilliant and creative, and yet **at the same time, it can be the source of great personal suffering and pain.** **To be free of this pain, we must understand the mind.** 
    - ### Lessons
    - ### Summary
        - In this session, we will learn 
            - what the mind is, 
            - where it came from, 
            - and why it creates the thoughts it does.
        - In this session, we began to explore the mind. We learned that the p**ure mind is a field of energy that creates thoughts** that you, the consciousness, are aware of. **The mind also receives and renders the world that comes in through the senses. **It** allows you to experience the outside world** and **to learn and grow from that experience. **
        - The **problem is that the mind creates an alternate reality out of thoughts.** It is **built of the impressions you stored from past experiences** you **either liked and tried to keep**** or could not handle and pushed away.** These stored impressions create what Michael calls **the personal mind.**
        - Based on your stored impressions, **you created a specific directive** as to **how the world in front of you needs to unfold** in order for you to feel good. **This alternate, mental reality prevents you from experiencing true reality,** and it ultimately causes you extreme suffering throughout your life. 
        - Caught in this fabricated world of thoughts, **you are no longer able to see the truth of life** **because your past personal experiences are prejudicing your mind. **Your past likes and dislikes are distorting your perception of the present moment unfolding before you. This further contributes to the building of the personal mind.
        - **Does it have to be this way?**** Ideally, the moment comes in, and you learn from it—both comfortable and uncomfortable. **You let the moment pass through you. **Letting moments pass through you is the act of surrender.**
        - **Surrender is the highest path because** it says, **“I want to experience who I truly am, not who I think I am.”** The **whole of spiritual growth** is **getting comfortable with all moments—the good and the bad.** When you are able to do this, you will begin to become free.
    - ### Reflection questions
        - In this session, we explored how the personal mind is built. After watching this session, are you able to distinguish the difference between personal thoughts and impersonal thoughts? Describe what you understand to be the difference.
        - How does the world in front of you need to unfold in order for you to feel good? Can you see that you have modeled it all within your mind? Can you see that this limits what will make you happy to the things you have decided you want? What would it be like to expand your comfort zone to include more of life?
        - In this session, we talked about “mind-blowing experiences.” We have mind-blowing experiences when we are able to center our consciousness on the experience we are having in front of us. Are you able to describe a recent experience where your mind was blown?
        - While hiking, the experience of spotting a coiled rattlesnake with a flickering rattle on your path is very different from the experience of a monarch butterfly landing on your arm during the same hike. As we learned in this session, every single thing that comes in is supporting your evolution, even a rattlesnake. Looking back, is there an experience in your own life that at the time upset you, but now on reflection, supporting you in becoming a better version of yourself today?
        - What are two experiences that you’ve had in your life that you feel left an impression on you, and now run your life? For example, you were bitten by a dog at the park when you were eight years old, and since then have avoided dogs your entire life. Or, you grew up in a beautiful town with redwoods and rivers, and now only dream of returning and settling down in a similar place like the beautiful town in which you once lived.
- ## Session 4 - The mind, part 2
    - ### Introduction
        - In this session, we continue the exploration of the mind and how to come to peace with it. We will learn that although we can willfully generate thoughts, most of the time we hear incessant personal chatter going on all by itself. Where do all those thoughts come from, and are they actually increasing or diminishing our chance for happiness?
    - ### Lessons
    - ### Summary
        - In this session, we continued the exploration of the mind. We learned that **if you use the personal mind to decide life is supposed to be a certain way**—the way you want—**you will continually suffer.** In truth, **the cause of suffering is not the way things are in life,** but that **you decide how you want life to be,** and **life does not go that way.** Manipulating the outside world to fit our stored stuff will** never work**, and **this is why the personal mind is so fearful.**
        - What do you imagine your life would look like **if you could experience the moment unfolding before you** **without the interference of the personal mind?**
        - **However, the mind is also a gift.** You have the same mind that discovered the atom, created the computer, or figured out E=MC2. You can run a business, write a book, or send a spaceship to the moon with this aspect of the mind. Like a computer, a blank blackboard, or an empty piece of paper, **your mind is the playground** in which you have **free will to create any thoughts you’d like.**
        - During this session, we examined the constant chatter of the voice inside your head. **Where does this voice in your head come from? **As we learned, when an experience unfolding in front of you presents itself and you resist it, **you are actually resisting the energy of the experience** and, as a result, **you capture the energy impression** deep inside of you. **These impressions you’ve stored** inside are **determining most of the thoughts** you are having right now. **These thoughts will continually occur until the stored impressions are able to pass through.**
    - ### Reflection questions
        - Have you ever had a dream that was obviously your mind releasing the stored energy of a past experience? What stored energy do you feel your dream was trying to release? Have you released that energy or is it still blocked in there?
        - What have you used your abstract or intellectual mind to create in your life? For example, you run a business, you play a musical instrument, you are a writer, you are taking this course.
        - We learned there is a lot of chatter happening on its own in the mind, and that chatter is the result of the impressions we’ve stored inside. Most of the time, we are so absorbed in these thoughts that we don’t even notice the mind is doing this. What does the voice inside your head sound like? What things does it talk to you about or tell you to do?
        - What do you imagine your life would look like if you could experience the moment unfolding before you without the interference of the personal mind?
- ## Session 5 - The spiritual heart
    - ### Introduction
        - In this session, we continue to peel back the layers of the psyche by exploring the heart. We will learn what the heart is and why it creates the emotions it does. We will also explore how the heart becomes so sensitive and blocked that it is difficult to live with. Given all of this, is it really possible to become comfortable with all the emotions and energies the heart creates? After all, coming to peace with your heart is a prerequisite to true surrender.
    - ### Lessons
    - ### Summary
        - By this point, it is clear that you are in there. You are aware of the world that is unfolding in front of you and that it has nothing to do with you. If you were not there, it would still unfold. You are also conscious of the thoughts created by your mind. These thoughts can be willfully created. However, much of the time they are really just happening on their own.
        - In this session, we continued to **peel back the layers of the psyche** by **focusing on the heart.** We learned that the **heart is an energy center,** and it is **very sensitive.** We saw that much is stored in the heart—including **the stuff you shoved out of your mind** from the past (samskaras). You are not your thoughts, and so too, you are not your emotions. **You are the experiencer of the emotions emanating from your heart.**
        - As you **learn to become established in the seat of Self,** you will start to be **able to quietly relax as the emotions pass through** your heart. 
            - **If you resist in the slightest,** you will have to struggle with these emotions. 
            - **If you do not resist,** you will **provide the room needed** for the stored energies to be released.
        - We saw that **surrender** is **the willingness to let go of the tendency** to **either resist the surfacing of these energies** **or to allow them to release their discomfort outwardly.**
        - **If you just inwardly relax and release,** these **energies from the heart will naturally rise upward** towards your higher energy centers. Over time, **this upward flow will fill you with a sense of being** fed from within. You will experience a constant flow of love, joy, and total well-being as your heart becomes purified.
    - ### Reflection questions
        - Have you ever had the experience of your heart suddenly opening, and as a result, you changed your entire life? How does this help you see how powerful the heart is?
        - In this past week, have you witnessed any of your stuff getting hit and all the discomfort you felt in your heart? If so, how did you react? For example, did you react and then later realize that you could have been centered and dealt with it differently? Or were you able to witness your stuff being hit and be OK with that?
        - In our interaction with the outside world, if a physical object comes too close, we instinctively put our hands up to protect ourselves. Can you see that we do the same thing inside with uncomfortable energies emanating from the heart? Can you imagine what it would be like to relax and allow the energies to pass through? What is stopping you?
- ## Session 6 - The predicament and the spiritual path
    - ### Introduction
        - In this session, we more fully explore the stored energy patterns from the past (samskaras) that are running your life. Michael explains in detail how these patterns are created and the difficulties they cause. What would happen if you decided to free yourself of these past patterns instead of using life to compensate for them? Once you start becoming serious about your inner work, you will begin to understand the power of a life of surrender.
    - ### Lessons
    - ### Summary
        - As we have already learned, we have stored patterns inside, which are called samskaras. These patterns are based upon past experiences that we did not let go of, and as a result, they were not able to pass through us. Instead, we either resisted the moment because we did not like it, or we clung to the moment because we did like it. You did this with your own free will.
        - In this session, we **explored the dynamics of these stored energy patterns and showed how they run your life.** Michael describes this as the predicament we find ourselves in.
        - **Your mind uses its power of imagination** to create situations and experiences that fit your stored patterns, all **in an attempt to make you feel better.** Basically, you are **either trying to match the energy patterns** you stored inside because it feels better, **or you are attempting to do the opposite and avoid the energy patterns** stored inside. Either way, **whether you are for or against them, these stored patterns are running your life. **This again, is what is meant by the predicament.
        - We **continue to distract ourselves from ourselves** with new houses, new jobs, new cities, and new relationships **because we are not OK inside. **We try to solve our inner problems with outer things. However, **as we learned, these are inner problems, and therefore they can only be solved inside.**
        - **You have a choice:** **every single moment of your life**
            - is either about getting what you want, 
            - or **letting go of the part of you** that is keeping you from being OK. 
            - Getting what you want is not going to make you permanently OK. However, you will always be OK if you let go of what is making you think you need something.
        - **Letting go of the blockages and cleaning out your patterns will set you free.** You free yourself to experience the moment unfolding in front of you, instead of defining what that moment needs to be for you to be OK.
        - Your entire life changes **when you decide to no longer live for your personal self**, and instead let go of it. When you do this, **your life becomes about the inner energy flow that is set free.** This is the spiritual path. In this session, we began to learn how to live this spiritual path—a life of surrender.
    - ### Reflection questions
        - What stored energy patterns are running your life?
        - As Michael explains in Session Six, you are allowed to want whatever you want. However, you’ll come to see that you don’t really want the thing you think you want—what you really want is what you think it will give you (happiness, fulfillment, etc.). Describe something you want below. Then, describe what you think it will give you. Would you still want it if you knew it wouldn’t give you that?
        - What could you let go of at work that you think you need? How would this affect your spiritual growth?
        - What could you let go of at home that you think you need? How would this a ect your spiritual growth?
        - What could you let go of from your past? How would this affect your spiritual growth?
- ## Session 7 - Learning to let go
    - ### Introduction
        - True spiritual growth is not about getting anything—it is always about letting go. In this session, we will learn that letting go is the highest spiritual path there is. You are absolutely capable of completely freeing yourself from what has you locked in the limits of your habitual thoughts. Michael shows us clear techniques and practices for letting go of what is keeping us from deep inner liberation.
    - ### Lessons
    - ### Summary
        - By now **you may have realized you have created a mess inside yourself**. Fortunately, you are absolutely **capable of completely liberating yourself** from what have you locked up and living within your alternate reality. In this session, **we began the process of unravelling the psyche and learning to let go.**
        - All of the spiritual growth is about letting go. It is not about getting anything. **You are not going to go where you want to go until you let go of yourself. You must let go of who you think you are in order to become who you are.** In this session, we learned how to do just that—let go. Michael provided instruction on **how to relax and release the samskaras.** We learned to **start with the easy things—the low-hanging fruit.** This **gives you the strength to handle the bigger things that come up.** Letting go is the highest spiritual path there is. You learn to surrender to the moment.
        - It is not difficult to realize **you have control issues based on your past experiences.** The need to control what is unfolding before you creates constant mind chatter, emotional turmoil, and extreme highs and lows. Your mind has tried to figure out how the world and everyone need to be for you to be OK. Now you must try to manipulate life to get it that way. Whether it is the weather, the driver in front of you, your kids, husband, or wife—**your mind has convinced you that every single thing has to be controlled.**
        - **In truth, you took your power to enjoy life away from yourself** by giving control of your thoughts to your past impressions. You gave your power away to the events that happened to you that you couldn’t handle. **Are you now ready to realize it is time to take your power back?** It is time to let the past patterns go.
    - ### Reflection questions
        - This week, try working on yourself in an everyday moment like driving. As you are driving, practice letting go of whatever is inside you and, as a result, become closer to the joy and happiness that you want to experience. Describe your experience below.
        - Several times this week, purposefully replace some of your negative thoughts with positive thoughts. For example, you are stuck in traffic and instead of complaining about the traffic, you say, “What a great opportunity to have some time and space to relax.” Describe three times this week where you purposefully changed your negative thoughts into positive thoughts below.
        - Begin to notice the garbage going on in your mind. Be the one who is noticing what is going on inside, and notice you are not it. You are aware, and this is what you are aware of. Once you notice, see if you are able to relax around those thought patterns. Below, describe three instances this week where you noticed the garbage going on in your mind. Were you able to relax?
        - As we learned in this session, if we cannot even handle something as simple as the weather, how will we be able to handle the different situations that life unfolds in front of us? Sometime this week, if you catch yourself complaining about the weather, turn your complaint into an affirmation. For example, “I don’t want it to snow. That means I have to dig my car out and get up early to deal with it,” is replaced with, “The snow blankets my front yard in beauty. It magically turns my brown yard into a winter wonderland.” Relax and lean away from the mind complaining. This creates a distance as you relax back into the seat of Self.
            - Describe a complaint you turned into an affirmation below.
            - Think about something from your past that was difficult to deal with at the time, and may still be uncomfortable to be with. Are you able to say, “Thank you for the learning experience”? If you are able to say, "thank you,” how does it feel? If you are not able to say "thank you” to the di cult experience, can you see why it stays stuck inside of you?
- ## Session 8 - 
    - ### Introduction
        - By now you’ve learned how to work on yourself to let go of the inner disturbances you’ve stored from your past. In this final session, we will take the ultimate step—making surrender of the personal the meaning of your life.
        - But what about your outer life? What happens to relationships, career, and nances while you are doing your inner work? Everybody asks this question, and we will explore in-depth the amazing life of surrender. While letting go inside, you will learn how to fully give yourself to the moment unfolding before you. When you exist in a state of surrender both inside and out, you live in harmony with the flow of life. You begin to experience a life free of anxiety and need. Once you reach this inner contentment, the higher spiritual states will naturally unfold within you—not through effort, but because there is nothing blocking them. There is a fountain of tremendous joy within you—are you ready to find it?
    - ### Lessons
    - ### Summary
        - **Surrender** is not surrendering to somebody; it **is the act of letting go of what is holding you back.** Surrender is not weakness; it is the ultimate strength. True surrender is, indeed, the entire spiritual journey. **If you seek the source of your being and surrender into it, you will come into harmony with the flow of life.** Once that happens, all doors will open.
        - However, **right now you are in quite the predicament.** You are conscious, and you are aware of what is unfolding in front of you. The world is coming in and you are definitely experiencing it. But **your mind is reacting to what’s coming in** because of the stored triggers from your past experiences. **The heart is reacting to the reactions of the mind** and **also leaking stored patterns on its own.** 
        - **You are in there, overwhelmed all the time, drowning.**
        - If you don’t want to continue struggling in life, if you don’t want to wake up every morning dreading the day, **the alternative is to clean up the mess.** The spiritual path is always about letting go of yourself. The purpose of your life is to let go of your stuff** so you can experience the beautiful upward flow of energy within.**
        - As you continue to surrender, **you will get to the point in your life** where you will not need a new house, a new relationship, or a trip around the world. **Your only desire will be to free yourself from yourself.** 
        - **As you become free, you naturally want to give to others, to serve every moment in life.** You begin to live your life with **the intention that every single moment that unfolds** in front of you is **better off because it did.**
    - ### Reflection questions
        - What was your biggest takeaway from the course?
        - In this session, Michael describes making surrender of the personal the meaning of your life. In your own words, describe what surrender means to you and how your life looks different since you started to surrender.
        - Thinking back on this past week, describe three experiences where you were able to relax and release in the moment.
        - Life is your spiritual practice. Everything that happens in life is an opportunity to be better than the moment before. Are you able to recognize that this is the most important thing in your life that you have to learn? In the space below, describe your own interpretation of the idea that life is your friend and your spiritual teacher.
