- I still feel [anxious](<anxious.md>) and [worry](<worry.md>) about the problem that appears in my life, like wifi problem. I also [worry](<worry.md>) about any events that will happen in the future, because I don't know what I feel at that moment. I worry that I will drop myself to a lower level of energy, and this makes me feel stressful. I want to change my attitude that instead of worry about what will happen, I will learn to handle any things happen with a [receiving attitude](<receiving attitude.md>)

## [September 21st, 2020](<September 21st, 2020.md>)
- I also felt kind of [uncomfortable](<uncomfortable.md>) and [annoying](<annoying.md>) about the problem that appears and I don't know how to handle it yet. [emotions](<emotions.md>) I want to become much more [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>) and develop a [receiving attitude](<receiving attitude.md>)
