- In order to be truly spiritual, I need to give up all of my personal desires, but it doesn't meant that I have to feel guilty for having money, status... Because they are just the tools that will support me to change the world. They're just like my health, my mind... The greater tools comes with greater responsibilities. I need to learn to be able to handle the tools, so that's I can do my real impersonal work for reality, like Michael Singer did.
