But I practiced remain [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>) this morning to accept even if that's situation happen. Actually it's just accept the movie that my mind created based on the stored samskaras, so first, it's not what happened yet, and even if it's happened, I have no other choice to accept and deal with it.
