- I learned that the way we organize our knowledge is very important to help us reach expertise. Experts seem to organize their knowledge around big ideas and concepts that help to guide their thinking in order to understand first, then seek solutions later.
    - Framework is also important as it will serve as a procedure that help an expert to solve things fast.
-  [Organization of knowledge](<Organization of knowledge.md>)
    - Around big ideas or concepts to guide thinking
    - Develop framework
    - Hierachial
    - Chunking-group
    - Interrelated chunking-group
- It feels so much easier to digest and absorb knowledge when I start to develop them into some simple frameworks. It's like a glue to connect things together.

    - https://udlguidelines.cast.org/
- It starts to clearer about how to teach other about [learning styles](<learning styles.md>)
    - It's about identify the main components of learning
        - Phong cách tiếp nhận thông tin
        - Phong cách xử lý thông tin
        - Phong cách học hỏi
    - Then breakdown it and help people to see how they prefer to learn in each type of that components
    - Finally help them develop a system that suitable for their own self-learning process
- I felt I learn so many things today and it's a little bit too much to digest for me.
- I learned that it's important to create an effective [framework](<framework.md>) as this will be serve as the path that help me to guide my development, and I will change base on the change of the framework.
- [Kolb's experiential learning model](<Kolb's experiential learning model.md>) seems like the model that suits me and will help me to learn faster than ever, as well as create my own learning process loop. [self-learning](<self-learning.md>)
    - Because it's easy to loop and the creation in this model make sense for me and it is what I am focus on.
    - I will need to take care and work more to complete my learning styles though, as it's a little bit limiting and not develop enough yet now.
