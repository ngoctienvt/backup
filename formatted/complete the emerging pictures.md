- By work from a top-down view, it provokes more things inside of me and requires me to put more energy to process it, because they are not emergence, but actually force to appear instead. It's good if the pictures are somehow connected to each other and just need to clarify. So [ðŸŒ²Top-down End-goal](<ðŸŒ²Top-down End-goal.md>) is hard to start with, but is good when the puzzles are in place and start to reveal the big pictures that we can complete by focus our attention on.
