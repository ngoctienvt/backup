- I noticed that my language about learning needs to change before I use words that describe "I still weak, still not strong enough". This way is basically saying that I'm not able to meet this challenge, but this is an unhelpful way of thinking because apparently, we aren't able to handle the challenge yet, so we are not enough for this. [generated language](<generated language.md>) 

Instead of looking at I'm not enough because this is the fact already, I can use [generated language](<generated language.md>) to support myself on a [helpful manner](<helpful manner.md>) are this helps me to realize my [imperfection](<imperfection.md>) or [deficiency](<deficiency.md>) that I could learn to [complement](<complement.md>) myself into a [wholer](<wholer.md>) soul.
- Whatever things I still look at problems and avoid is because I am not fully embracing that I'm an [eternal soul](<eternal soul.md>). I haven't fully experienced myself and establish myself on that spot, so I still can easily get lost on to the [object of consciousness](<object of consciousness.md>). [self-experience](<self-experience.md>) [self-trust](<self-trust.md>)
- I still have so many levels of experiences that I have preferences for and this makes me unconsciously protect these needs and clings [preferences](<preferences.md>). They can always good in a short-term, but will be a hindrance for a higher way of living life. 

[living from the place of surrender](<living from the place of surrender.md>) is fully orient myself into a higher life, but at the same time fully experiences what levels I am at as the stepping stones for my next level. [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>)
- The ratio for my [Workflow for an surrender life](<Workflow for an surrender life.md>) is not clear yet, I only have the ratio of some activities now are
    - Meditation - half morning, half afternoon
    - Writing, relaxing, reading, working - the remaining half
    - There are a time for bottom-up [diffuse mode](<diffuse mode.md>) and time for top-down [focus mode](<focus mode.md>)
    - I will test this on the next week
- I felt that I still [worry](<worry.md>) too much for [Nguyễn Mỹ Linh](<Nguyễn Mỹ Linh.md>), she's on the vulnerable and overwhelm stages. However, all of what I can do for her now is [trust the process](<trust the process.md>) that she will be able to over come these challenges, and give her the best [impersonal support](<impersonal support.md>) as possible. 
- [joy of missing out](<joy of missing out.md>) versus [fear of missing out](<fear of missing out.md>) [fear](<fear.md>)
    - “Oh the joy of missing out. 
When the world begins to shout
And rush towards that shining thing;
The latest bit of mental bling–
Trying to have it, see it, do it,

You simply know you won't go through it;
The anxious clamoring and need
This restless hungry thing to feed.
Instead, you feel the loveliness;
The pleasure of your emptiness.

You spurn the treasure on the shelf
In favor of your peaceful self;
Without regret, without a doubt.
Oh the joy of missing out”

- One of most biggest strength are the willingness to know the truth no matter what, but it's also the biggest hinderance if I become so attach with this way of living, because it focused too much on the method. [hindering](<hindering.md>) [two sides of the same coin](<two sides of the same coin.md>)
- It felts so much good and natural that I start to connect my thoughts, my inspiration, my interest from too high to where am at.
- I learned a big thing that when we are going far ahead enough, everything that we see at problems are not problems anymore. [truth compass](<truth compass.md>) [the gap of competencies](<the gap of competencies.md>)

So what I want to have is the ability to focus myself to the fact that [living from the place of surrender](<living from the place of surrender.md>)
    - as long as I'm moving forward, things will stop exist in its own way [transformation](<transformation.md>)
- When reading Cửu tinh bá thể quyết, I felt so open that there is no need to fear for what others critic us, because there will always exist a hold in their arguments. [fear of critics](<fear of critics.md>) [fear](<fear.md>) [debate](<debate.md>)
    - The hole lie on the beginning phrase
    - The hole lie on the exceptions or whether the phrase is universal and including everything or not
    - The hole lie on the initial intention and the cause of that intention

- The laptop makes me realize that I am trying to get the best instead of getting enough so that the tools will become a supporter rather than a big pressure for me. [the middle way](<the middle way.md>)
- In order to avoid losing on the method, the tools, the attachments, focus on [end goal](<end goal.md>) [focus on what matters](<focus on what matters.md>)
    - the impersonal wants
    - the fun aspects
    - the meaning aspects

    - The main victory condition is create fears to reduce the conditions to win the game, or win by using all fear cards only. 
    - Characteristics of the spirit
        - The spirit is good at defense, but be careful with the range of power cards is too low (mostly 0).
        - The spirit is fast to handle the perceived threats, but not good at slow powers.
        - This spirit is quite good as generating energy for [major powers](<major powers.md>) but not so good at increasing card plays.
        - The spirit struggles to remove the threats, because they can only remove them through Dahan fight back.
    - The main strategy to play him is 
        - having some good defense to buy time, 
        - try to use as much as major powers with 2 cards as possible because he's hard to unlock the 3 card plays.
        - moving [Dahan](<Dahan.md>) in a proper way to fight back for removing threats
