- Whatever things I still look at problems and avoid is because I am not fully embracing that I'm an [eternal soul](<eternal soul.md>). I haven't fully experienced myself and establish myself on that spot, so I still can easily get lost on to the [object of consciousness](<object of consciousness.md>).

- With Má»¹ Linh, I realized that I still have the [fear](<fear.md>) to be [misunderstanding](<misunderstanding.md>) by her and it makes me not naturally myself. I still want to be the person who's always right with her. I felt that I need to prove I'm right instead of just trusting myself completely. [self-trust](<self-trust.md>)
