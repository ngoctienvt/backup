## [Closing the transformational gap](<Closing the transformational gap.md>)
- [means](<means.md>)

- For example: what we aim to will be the [end goals](<end goals.md>), but [the transformational gap](<the transformational gap.md>) is too big that we need to find some [intermediary goals](<intermediary goals.md>) so we can move forward and upgrade ourselves in the process. [means](<means.md>)

- Most clients can only see their [intermediary goals](<intermediary goals.md>) and focus too much to the [means](<means.md>)

## [October 4th, 2020](<October 4th, 2020.md>)
- So what's important is to realize that the truth is there to be find out, but it does not belong to anyone. The [truth](<truth.md>) belong to itself, and everything else are just the [means](<means.md>)

- I need to see things [as a whole](<as a whole.md>) instead of separation and understand the process behind everything more deeply so I can use the [means](<means.md>)
