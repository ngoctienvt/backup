- Why?
    - The main meaning of [compressed process](<compressed process.md>) is to help you achieve [deeper understanding](<deeper understanding.md>) about the topics, concepts, so you can merge your scattering thoughts to a pearl of wisdom. 
        - [compressed understanding](<compressed understanding.md>)
        - prepare high-quality materials or tools for generating output
- How to organize compressed information?
    - The information will be organized in a way that can edit or add-on later, or support [compressed process](<compressed process.md>) or support the next [compressed process](<compressed process.md>).
    - The concept will be isolated by itself or could be live in a bigger concept to make it wholer, but understanding will be centered around the idea of the topic concept.
        - For example, if I have a bottom-up evolution concept, then I will have a progressive approach that cover the bottom-up evolution concept. And I want to keep them relate but separate at the same time? How will I solve this?
            - In the bottom-up evolution concept, I will work on everything related directly to this and develop my understand it over time.
            - While in the progressive approach, the bottom-up evolution concept is just an application to this approach, not about fully understand the concept separately.
- The condensing process:
    - collecting meaningful data (summarize, key take-aways, new awareness, new understanding...)
    - resolving [Expanding questions](<Expanding questions.md>) and inbox
    - structuring understandings
    - clean clustering and re-organize information if needed

- To create star and maintain the focus on it, it requires an enormous energy to hold the star and extract the connection around it. This energy is used for [maintaining information process](<maintaining information process.md>) and [extract and gather information process](<extract and gather information process.md>) instead of using for [compressed process](<compressed process.md>).

- I feel that I accumulate a lot of thoughts and they even become some big paragraphs that I didn't even imagine from the beginning with.  [compressed process](<compressed process.md>)

- The next step is I start to want to condense thoughts, and I'm not sure how I will start with. The reason is I feel that many thoughts that I write is only need some edit, so I don't want to write it again. [compressed process](<compressed process.md>)

- The condensing process is now little bit more [intentional](<intentional.md>) or [goal-driven](<goal-driven.md>), but not too much as [compressed process](<compressed process.md>).

- Connecting instead of categorizing. Categorizing is to help the mind able to [extract and gather information](<extract and gather information.md>) easier, but it's not the real power of the mind. The power of it is on the ability to generate new things from old things. [generative wisdom](<generative wisdom.md>) [compressed process](<compressed process.md>)

- We can also give it materials by input experiences, reading books, experimenting,... This is [input process](<input process.md>) so the mind can have materials to continue it [compressed process](<compressed process.md>).
