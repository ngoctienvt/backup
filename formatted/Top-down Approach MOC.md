- The role of [Top-down Approach MOC](<Top-down Approach MOC.md>) is 
    - gaining clarity about direction and big picture that emerge from [Bottom-up Approach MOC](<Bottom-up Approach MOC.md>)
        - [personal end goals](<personal end goals.md>) 
        - Seeing big picture or the direction [big picture thinking](<big picture thinking.md>)
    - align things to serve the end goal or purpose effectively [on the right track](<on the right track.md>)
    - creating space for exploring, experiment and learning without the fear of being wrong
        - [soft-boundary](<soft-boundary.md>)
        - [Map of Contents](<Map of Contents.md>) [bottom-line](<bottom-line.md>)
        - The boundary need to be clear about what is okay to be keep open and what is not.
            - What is okay?
                - add-on information - are information that will be accumulated and condensed and restructred if it started to excess number 5.
                - [direct-related connections](<direct-related connections.md>) are the connection that directly relate to its [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>). The [direct-related connections](<direct-related connections.md>) can also become the [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>) of other smaller connections
                    - The highest atomic thing would be me. [trueself](<trueself.md>) Anything else is just my relationship with them.
                - Limited direct connection - temporary maximum 5.
                    - When there are more than 5 connections, it's a good time to condense these things and organize them in a hierarchy way. So that's making sure there is only 5 [direct-related connections](<direct-related connections.md>) for the [atomic concept](<atomic concept.md>).
            - What is not okay?
                - Too many direct connections
                - Try to link to different context - should be focus on 1 thing only
