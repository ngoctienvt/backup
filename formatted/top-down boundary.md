- [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) is an approach that focuses more on working with detail level and understanding the specific situation or context, the moment, the difference.
- [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) helps to understand thing in a deeper level and honor the moment.
- [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) helps to create a direction to utilizes the information that gathered from [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>) to a specific usage.
- [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) is just simply create a space for me to work things on, not to start from there downward, but actually create a destination for me to build-up to there overtime.

- It's helpful to split things down so we can perform ourselves on that role and learn to master these roles separately. However, it's also unconsciously create hard [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>)

- The [starting point](<starting point.md>) of everything is established a solidify [basic foundation](<basic foundation.md>) so that I can come back at any time. The role of a basic foundation is to establish a [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>),

- The reason to have a [starting point](<starting point.md>) is to realize that things have different levels or different progress to work on. [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>)

- After establishing a starting point, the next thing is about the [mastery](<mastery.md>) process. The process of mastery is what's I actually do in the [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>)

I feel that I start to put unnecessary pressure on me to top-down things instead of letting the bottom-up build up itself. [need for big pictures](<need for big pictures.md>) [personal needs](<personal needs.md>).
