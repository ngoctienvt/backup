- [what matters](<what matters.md>) or [end goal](<end goal.md>) are the intention that I make clear in the beginning or intentional adjusting in the process, not the tools or the method I have and grow an [attachment](<attachment.md>) with them.
- [focus on what matters](<focus on what matters.md>) are holding focus onto [end goal](<end goal.md>) and aware that [tools](<tools.md>) or [method](<method.md>) are just a means to make the process of achieving [end goal](<end goal.md>) become easier and more effective.

But sometimes I focus too much on the process of sharing and forget the [end goal](<end goal.md>) are not sharing, but how helpful they are with them and how they can utilize it to become better.
