- [what matters](<what matters.md>) or [end goal](<end goal.md>) are the intention that I make clear in the beginning or intentional adjusting in the process, not the tools or the method I have and grow an [attachment](<attachment.md>) with them.
- [focus on what matters](<focus on what matters.md>) are holding focus onto [end goal](<end goal.md>) and aware that [tools](<tools.md>) or [method](<method.md>) are just a means to make the process of achieving [end goal](<end goal.md>) become easier and more effective.

- My main concern when I'm looking for [Webflow](<Webflow.md>) is I don't want to spend much time to worry about hosting, maintaining, and dealing with security stuff. I want a system that I can trust and rely on and just work on the important stuff instead. [focus on what matters](<focus on what matters.md>)

- Other is the fear of lacking features. I felt that I could just let it go, as I didn't even develop my habit to show the work yet, I'm thinking too early about the other stuff like how I will make money from this. Money will just a by-prodct. The main focus will be share my work and support other from that work. [focus on what matters](<focus on what matters.md>)

- I noticed that I have a big desire to support other people to become better and that makes me want to share I know, what I find out to support them. But sometimes I focus too much on the process of sharing and forget the [end goal](<end goal.md>) are not sharing, but how helpful they are with them and how they can utilize it to become better.
