- [weekly reflection](<weekly reflection.md>)
    - Highlights of the week:
        - My mind is starting to clearer and much more clarity about [true relationship](<true relationship.md>), [üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth](<üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth.md>), [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>)
        - Many new concepts that I learned this week help me to concrete my thinking and knowledge much more. This next week will be an exciting week to know what they will emerge when I'm deepen my understanding about them, and connect them together.
        - I feel so much peaceful and happy now as I can see that's I'm becoming better each day, each week, and I can let go more and more stuff inside of my heart over time.
        - I also noticed that last week my health was heavily impacted due to I feel hard to sleep. I will work more on this on the next week so that's I could use my bed time better and effective. [energy management](<energy management.md>)
        - I learned that [end goal](<end goal.md>) is very important, because if we focus to means goal, we may never reach the end goal, because we work indirectly to get it. And because we work indirectly, we put more condition for ourselves to get our end goals. 
        - I learned that I'm not good at interacting with people in daily life situation, I'm favor meaningful conversations rather than simply sharing the joy with each other. [true relationship](<true relationship.md>)
        - I start to see the relationship between [Level of expertise](<Level of expertise.md>) and [Bloom's taxonomy](<Bloom's taxonomy.md>) as in order to move up level of expertise, we will need to work more on analyze, evaluate and creation stage.
            - [üå±PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System](<üå±PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System.md>) serve as a way to solidify our creation to work more on later.
        - My [Life's Guiding Principles MOC](<Life's Guiding Principles MOC.md>) is also that I will not force things to happen, but focus on myself and let things happen naturally. For example, I will develop and do my main work, instead of trying to persuade or attach with other people for something that I think will good for them.
- [üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth](<üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth.md>)
    - My visualization image is a container that holds piece off information that wait for me to analyze and create my own knowledge. [knowledge storage](<knowledge storage.md>)
- My intention to [serving the demand of reality](<serving the demand of reality.md>) is helping people aim higher instead of helping them avoid what they don't way or achieve what they want.
    - Want is a word that easily to be misunderstood, I want to help a way to rephrase this properly. [Want](<Want.md>)
        - I want is easier to come from our samskaras (lower-self or lower-thought) that serve the personal self rather than come from the witness consciouss and higher-thought that nurture over time to serve the reality.
- While we focus on the tools or the way, we easily lost ourselves and operate ourselves around it, but this is a limited way to live life. Always aim to true [end goal](<end goal.md>) will ensure that we always focus on the right thing, and require us to grow, learn, adapt properly with the unfolding reality instead.
    - Start with limitless consciousness, end with limitless end goal.
- I noticed that with [Bloom's taxonomy](<Bloom's taxonomy.md>)
    - There will be different elements on each stage
        - Creating maybe natural with emergence, but can also actively create with different strategies
        - Analyzing will have different ways of analyze. 
        - The difference between applying and understanding is applying is about reality situation, understanding maybe only on simulated situation or classrom situation
    - My own taxonomy will be a bit different with Bloom's [level of thinking](<level of thinking.md>)
        - My taxonomy also about different levels of human thinking level
            - The word to describe is describe what happens for that person on that stage.
            - My approach for learning is not skip the foundation to reach the end goal soon, but rather build them up slowly, but ideally, I will create a way that help people to learn at multiple stages at once (Capstone Project), instead of move up level by level.
        - The first level is Knowing which people simply learn and accumulate their knowledge around certain topics
        - The second level is Understanding which people start to form their own mental concept (personal keywords) based on their knowing about the topics
        - The third level is Applying which people start to apply and learn
        - The 4th level is Integrating which people analyze what they accumulated so far and formed their own structure - Higher-order of thinking which requires Abstract thinking
            - the requirement is simply to gather and organise information, as well as understand it.
        - The 5th level is Evaluating which is breaking things down and understand every components and interactions deeply so that we could go from Competent to Proficiency 
            -  the focus of learning outcomes at the level of Evaluate is on the student‚Äôs ability to make informed decisions and suggestions based on a given set of information. 
                - Compare two individual pieces of music and find their musical similarities (Analyse)
                - Recommend ways of combining these two songs (Evaluate)
        - The 6th level is Creating which people start to have their own system and complete it eventually by themselves, and create their own personal stuff based on this
            - Result in some kind of tangible outcome
    - Somehow [Level of expertise](<Level of expertise.md>) will also relate to this
        - In novice, people simply read and know
            - In this stage, I focus on read and tag to start to form my knowledge networks 
        - In beginner, people start to see the relation between what they know in certain context
            - In this stage, I mainly take note about my practices, my insights, my new understanding so it will gather and condense my expertise.
        - In competent stage, people are good at apply what they learned but still rule-based and not much their own stuff yet
            - In this stage, I will start to nurture and form my knowledge networks about that topics
        - In proficient stage, people start to be able to instinctually know what's important which comes from their own analyze about what they gone through and Integrate it to themselves.
            - In this stage, I will go up and down abstract and concrete level to fill the picture clearly
        - In expert stage, people start to create their own method of doing things, personalized it, and they do not just instinctually know what's important, but also how to do it.
            - In this stage, I will mainly practice more and accumulate more lessons so that I could become better and better.
- I start to see more clearly about the [workplace](<workplace.md>) for my thinking is
    - Roam Research for thoughts processing
    - Milanote and Notability could be for link ideas and visual it so that I could see the connections easier.
        - Milanote also seems be a good place for me to keep my end goals and what's require to focus on - [focus management](<focus management.md>)
    - Notion for publish stuff that need to have proper decorate and storage.
- [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>) 
    - One of its aspect is finding our end goals
    - Finding what we need to reach our end goals
    - And start to think about 
        - how to move us forward it consistently
        - how to overcome the stuck
        - how to handle what distract us out of our roads
- [üå±Instructional Design](<üå±Instructional Design.md>) 
    -  ‚Äúscaffolding‚Äù is used to describe the process of learning incrementally. 
    - Once the student has mastered the higher-level verbs, the scaffold can be ‚Äúremoved‚Äù and new skills can be built up from that point. 
- I can clearly see that I'm building a bridge with reality and true end goal [bridging](<bridging.md>). I also can start to really understand more what's [closing the gap](<closing the gap.md>) actually is.
- [üå±Workflow ](<üå±Workflow .md>) My workflow ratio will have 2 main components
    - The ratio of [level of thinking](<level of thinking.md>) and general daily activities 
    - The [level of thinking](<level of thinking.md>) of the topic that I'm working on. Sometimes I'm trying to work on high level without building bottom level. This need to balance and execute properly to match with [üå±Progressive Development Approach](<üå±Progressive Development Approach.md>)
