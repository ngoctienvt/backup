- I noticed that I still involve too much in dreams instead of simply detach and let them go. [dream](<dream.md>) This is the main reason why I felt tired after sleeping because I’m not fully recharged. Even in the awake stage, I’m not easy to disidentify [establishing the seat of awareness](<establishing the seat of awareness.md>) and making conscious choices.
- [conscious choice](<conscious choice.md>) is really not necessary. It's necessary now because I have many [samskaras](<samskaras.md>) that diverge myself in different directions. If they do not exist and integrate as a whole, there will be only 1 direction to go, and at that time, there will be no need to make [conscious choice](<conscious choice.md>).

But now I still need to make [conscious choice](<conscious choice.md>) to keep myself working on [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>) as well as direct myself to the path that will exist when everything is merged. [the only path](<the only path.md>)
- [ ] Working merging between [focus mode](<focus mode.md>) and [diffuse mode](<diffuse mode.md>) through an example.
- Watching Dota 2 make me realize that a great [teamwork](<teamwork.md>) is about everyone can manifest their full potentials first, after that the synergy and interaction with each other will follow up naturally.

Because if they have to hinder their potential to match their teammates, they are limiting themselves as well as limit the ability to grow of their teammates. [meeting the demand of reality](<meeting the demand of reality.md>)
- [complement](<complement.md>)  don't happen just because of thoughts, ideas, but through checking with reality. It means that I can't just think it's right, but reality will be the one who let me know how right it is and how much I'm still missing. 

The first level is reflection and hypothesis. 
The second is real-life experiments to test the above.
The third level is to complement what is missing.
- I noticed that I rarely give [compliments](<compliments.md>) to other people. The reason is I feel that if it's giving freely, it's not really a compliment but actually flattering. The true [compliments](<compliments.md>) requires a true [acknowledgment](<acknowledgment.md>) with full presence to receive and to notice what deserves to compliment.
- [focus mode](<focus mode.md>) + [diffuse mode](<diffuse mode.md>) = [being mode](<being mode.md>) [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>)
    - [being mode](<being mode.md>) seems like the mode that fuse between the focus and diffuse mode.
    - In [being mode](<being mode.md>), I will able to connect my inner energy to get in touch with reality, instead of being block by inner [samskaras](<samskaras.md>) [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>). [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>)
    - The hard part is this kind of connection is not stable at the moment, and in the early stage of [being mode](<being mode.md>), I will work on how to establish this connection in a stable way. [diffuse mode](<diffuse mode.md>) is very important here, because this is when I clean the blockages with relaxation and [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>).
    - When the connection is stable enough and there is very little blockages, I also know very clearly what I focus on, this is when [being mode](<being mode.md>) will be natural to express the inner energy to [serving the demand of reality](<serving the demand of reality.md>).
    - [ ] My early important task now is to clear the blockages and establish a stable connection between the inner energy, the seat of awareness and the reality.
- I noticed that I only like to support people through their journey fully, instead of being a place for them to temporarily feel better, but not actually recognize and handle it. [sustainable development](<sustainable development.md>) [short-term solutions](<short-term solutions.md>)
- the need for [convenient](<convenient.md>) and the tendency to proctect myself through talking is really two main things that hinder me to connect with other people.
- [refining and delivering process](<refining and delivering process.md>) 
    - Is it worth saying? to ensure that it's helpful and not [personal needs](<personal needs.md>)
    - Is it said clearly?  to ensure that it's easy to understand and digest [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)
    - Is it said beautifully? to ensure that it's easy to integrate [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)
- I felt that I have been going a far journey to meet the truth that I'm always seeking. I felt so grateful and exhausting at the same time. [truth-seeking](<truth-seeking.md>) 
    - The reason why I feel [grateful](<grateful.md>) is at least now I'm not wasting time for half-solutions anymore and can only focus to work on a true [sustainable development](<sustainable development.md>).
    - The reason why I feel [exhausting](<exhausting.md>) is because this path is unlimited, and there are so much things that I need to clean, to clear, to handle that I accumulate for so long.
    - Inside of me still have a tendency to wish that solve everything as fast as possible so that I could only feel the good thing. This tendency makes me to not fully accept the process of evolution. It's another cling and resist to the truth of life [acceptance](<acceptance.md>). [convenient](<convenient.md>)
    - This tendency is based on the fact that I'm not fully taking [personal responsibilities](<personal responsibilities.md>) for my life, and still wish that there is a miracle somewhere that will help me to solve my own problems. [resistance](<resistance.md>)
    - The good thing is I'm doing better everyday, every month now. I can really see that I'm becoming more and more clean inside, and it's true cleaner. This process may take long times, but there is no other choices. I'm starting to really learn to 
        - take fully [personal responsibilities](<personal responsibilities.md>), 
        - develop [abundance appreciation](<abundance appreciation.md>) for the existence of life, 
        - accept the [soul evolution](<soul evolution.md>) journey as a part of the fun, the true meaning of life whether how tough it is. 
- [free writing](<free writing.md>) At this stage of life, I feel that I'm on a transition period that happens slowly but truly sustainable. My main job now is not external work. I coach a few clients, half-teach a class, translate a few videos, develop a course for mind-training. 

But these are not my main focus. My main focus is to do the inner work. From the moments I realize that the problems that I think need to solve, what I want, what I afraid,... are all because of the inner samskaras that I haven't handled and they determine my thoughts, my feelings, my choices now. I thought they are me but not, they are just disturbing me to make real choices. 

I also realize that at I'm on my journey, I'm bringing people who trust this path together with me. The path is not personal for me, I'm just understanding and realizing it due to the teaching of my teacher, [Michael Singer](<Michael Singer.md>). My job is not proud of about myself, but rather learn to humble to support other people that trust me to try this path [humility](<humility.md>).

I feel there is a rush inside me to skip the cleaning step. It's like running a marathon but wish that I will be at the end of the road without paying too much effort and skip the reality. This tendency is related to my [convenient](<convenient.md>) need to have everything right now just because I know what I want.

My big life lesson here is learning to appreciate the process of [soul evolution](<soul evolution.md>), and work on it in a diligent way. I'm learning the lesson of [persistence](<persistence.md>) and appreciate the existence of everything, not exclude anything.
-  I'm in a transition to shift from enjoying what brings good experiences to enjoy the result of the integration process. [enjoy the learning experience](<enjoy the learning experience.md>) This enjoyment is harder to attain, but it's sustainable and feels much satisfied. [true satisfaction](<true satisfaction.md>)
