- The purpose of this post:
    - Condensing my thoughts about the evolution of mind. The fundamental for mind training
    - Building a practical application to use Roam Research for bottom-up our mind fearlessly and in flow.
    - The benefits of Roam Research to support your mind to work as its most important gift.
- Outline
    - How Roam Research helped me to mind evolution?
        - The [nature of human mind](<nature of human mind.md>)
        - A metaphor about the human mind:
            - The human mind looks like a universe with each star is a node that represents a concept or idea. The stars in the universe operate inter-related with each other but do not have a hierarchy structure.
            - The human mind can create a new star based on the materials of the current nodes through a connecting and generating process. The more the node is polished and connected (the big star), the deeper and broader our understanding of it is. 
            - Our universe mind needs the energy to develop its universe, and there are 3 main jobs that our brain spend its energy are:
                - Stored information (maintain the stars to not die off)
                - Recall information (extract information from the stars)
                - Generate new meanings or connections (create new advanced stars)
        - How [structure of society](<structure of society.md>) makes us limit our mind and uses it counter-intuitive?
            - Our nature of mind is structure-less, but the actual life we lived built on a structured society that unconsciously limits our unlimited mind. For example, company structure, family structure, apps we use, the definition of concepts like success, happiness, good, bad, right, or wrong,..
        - How our mind evolve and our human wisdom accumulate?
            - The human mind mainly evolves in a bottom-up manner at the beginning of times when there is no one taught us yet except reality, and what we learned now is just the wisdom of humans that accumulated by many evolved minds. 
            - Each of us is a part of that human collective wisdom, so we are not meant to learn what already there and stop, but to continue bottom-up wisdom to higher and higher wisdom.
- [Benefits of Roam Research](<Benefits of Roam Research.md>):
- How [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>) helped me to evolve my mind in a much more natural and effective way?
    - First I will analyze how [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>) helped my mind to release its ineffective functions to focus mainly on meaningful function. 
    - Our universe mind has 3 main functions: 
        - Recall and hold information: our mind is also not good at retrieving information, it is not good to hold multiple concepts at once, and hard to maintain them in our head. Most research shows that our mind can hold about 3 or 4 things at once, so actually our mind is not good at withdrawing and maintaining pieces of information needed to process. 
        - Generate new meanings or connections: this is what our human mind is really shine at. It's superb at generating new ideas, higher thoughts, deepen our understanding unconsciously.
        - Store information: our mind is not good at memory like a capture, instead it tends to remember sentimental information, and remembers things through connection or repetition, so our mind is not a good [information storehouse](<information storehouse.md>).
    - Now, we know that it's better if we can use most of our brain energy into its third task - generating instead of storing or recalling and maintaining information for processing. This is where we can start to analyze about note-taking apps.
        - First, many apps are very good at working as an [information storehouse](<information storehouse.md>) like Evernote or Notion. However, this works in a hierarchy structure that didn't keep a concept or idea as a node that inter-related, but rather separating them into different categorizations with multiple concepts. [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>) works better because it can store information as a node easily.
        - Second, many apps are not easy to connect and recall the information related to a concept and hold the space for us to quickly review, recheck, and work on it. Some apps start to have bi-directional linking now, but the process does not feel flow and easy to navigate. In Roam Research, I feel much more flow to link my nodes, to retrieve, and to hold the space for myself to works on them. 
        - Third, this is the most important thing. Most apps are not designed as networked thoughts with structure-less, because if our mind generates a higher concept or condense scatter thoughts into higher thoughts. Then how we can store it in a hierarchy structure and adapt our system as our mind operates in a different level? 
            - My main point here is Roam Research helped me to realize that in order to evolve my mind, it's best to works from the bottom-up approach continuously. As my mind evolve, the system will evolve itself. I don't need to learn too much beforehand, and I just need to focus on where I am, and bottom-up from that. If I need anything else, I just change them from the new stars and leave the old star died off. The structure-less of [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>) is what really got me into the evolution of mind concept.
- How Roam Research rewards us by [accumulate thought process](<accumulate thought process.md>) exponentially?
    - When you start to use [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>) simply by a bottom-up approach, each free thought is like a penny that you put into your bank account, and they will give you interest over time.
    -  I gained so much more that I can bottom-up many complicated concepts that I need to works on and deepen my understand slowly. The stars you created is never got wasted, but just continuously generate new advanced stars day by day. 
- How Roam Research can help us grow spiritually and live the surrender life? [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>) [surrender](<surrender.md>)
    - This is very huge to me and I didn't realize it in the beginning. The truth is life is unfolding itself and we have very little control over it. For example, how many cells in your body that you can control right now? I learned this from my spiritual teacher, Michael Singer - the author of The untethered soul and The surrender experiment books.
    - In Roam Research, it's the same. I just start to accumulate, and condense my thoughts slowly, and they build up and my brain generates new connections that I haven't thought before. My job is just accumulate them and condensing them continuously over time. I will look for how this mind surrender experimenting will give me in over months or years.
    - As Roam Research structure-less which encourages free writing, it also helps me to recognize my emotions and my inner chatter, so I can handle them with and start to free myself out of my inner thoughts much easier and not feel wasted, because what I write is now accumulated interest.
- How our brain develop or evolve?
    - I break it down into 3 main steps:
        - [accumulate scattering thoughts process](<accumulate scattering thoughts process.md>) is a bottom-up process to gather random thoughts or ideas that generate by our mind
        - [condensing and generative process](<condensing and generative process.md>) is a bottom-up process to condense the thoughts we gathered and transform them into higher thoughts or ideas
        - [real life application](<real life application.md>) is a top-down process that we start to have a top-down problem that we want to solve, an article that we want to write, a concept that we want to understand, a product that we want to build...
- Practical application process
    - [accumulate scattering thoughts](<accumulate scattering thoughts.md>)
    - [compressed process](<compressed process.md>)
    - [compressed process](<compressed process.md>)

- Learn to release the need for control and let life unfold
