- I start to see much clearer the difference between take care of the soul and take care of the human being.
    - The food of the soul is the shakti and the experiences.
    - The human being self is just the experiences that the soul can't handle and mis-navigation itself.
    - In order to truly happy, the soul will need to be the anchor of itself, clear the past samskaras, the self-concept, and learn to embrace life itself.
- I also start to be transition myself
    - From efficient tendency to effective tendency.
    - From being right to being effective.
    - From human being to witness conscious
    - From fear to experiment
    - From controlling to being and loving
    - From limiting to limitless
    - From concepting to self-knowing
