- There are some facts of your life that will always be the facts of your life.
- There are some facts of each day that will always be the facts of each day. 
- When we feel most stuck and helpless, it’s because we’ve bought into the idea that our choices, and choices alone, determine the outcomes of our lives. Our real choosing power is actually how we respond to what we didn’t choose. __The way we react to the reality that is in front of us is how we invent the next reality we will experience.__  [Surrend to the truth of the world](<Surrend to the truth of the world.md>) [impersonal choices](<impersonal choices.md>) [choiceless awareness](<choiceless awareness.md>)
- Our power isn’t in what exists, but how we respond to what exists.
    - After you’ve chosen your life partner, it’s up to you to decide how you react to them each day — to their worst moments, to your arguments, to times of tension. It’s also up to you to decide how you react to their wins, to their presence, and to their love. It is up to you to decide how you react to their presence in your life.
    - After you’ve chosen your career path, it’s up to you to decide how you react to new opportunities, to projects, to the work that is in front of you. It is up to you how you react to your frustrating coworkers, your unreasonable boss. It’s up to you to decide how you react to even having work in the first place, and whether you are grateful, or whether you are inconvenienced.
    - After you’ve chosen where to live, it’s up to you to decide how you live there. It’s up to you to decide how you respond to your environment, whether you connect with your community, whether you take long walks around the block, whether you care for your space, whether your open the windows and feel thankful to have a home at all.
- Every one of these moments presents us with an opportunity to find our free will, and that doesn’t always mean being tough and pretending to be unaffected. Washing over our experience with positivity isn’t always the best way to respond, because it’s not always the most authentic way to respond.
    - Sometimes, the most powerful thing we can do is cry, to truly release and shed the feelings pent up inside. Where a reality once stood to break us, we opened our hearts and let out the truth of our grief. Sometimes, the most powerful thing we can do is rest, to completely let go and nourish ourselves. Where a reality stood to wear us down, we took our energy back. 
    - Sometimes, the most powerful thing we can do is just to be still and to allow the answers to come to us, because reaching for them sometimes keeps them just outside of our reach.
    - Sometimes, the most powerful thing we can do is lift our hands up and just laugh, because life is wild, because there is so much we don’t expect, because we all take it so seriously, because it’s all temporary anyway.
- Even the things we think we choose are often being selected from a series of reactions we don’t know we’re having.
- ### Instead of trying to control everything around you, work on trying to control your reaction to everything around you.
    - Where others see dead-ends, can you see redirections? Where others see closed-mindedness, can you see woundedness?
    - Where others see stupidity, can you see defensiveness? Where others see unwillingness, can you find gratitude?
    - Where others see hopelessness, can you find a shred of light? Where others see finalities, can you imagine beginnings?
- And if you don’t quite have the strength for that right now, can you, at least, feel a smidge of relief and gratitude for all that you do have in this uncertain and reckless world?
