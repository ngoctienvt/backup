- ### What is the LYT System
    - LYT stands for "Linking Your Thinking". Which is a system of knowledge management based on using links—and especially with using higher-order notes like a Home note and Maps of Content to enhance your thinking. See [LYT System](<LYT System.md>).
- LYT provides a framework for your notes. You can find them. You can work with them. And this framework encourages them to grow more valuable over time.
    - **The Home note** - The Home note can act as your homebase to ground you, and as a launching pad into your note library.
    - **Maps of Content** (MOCs) - These are like having curated worktables with all your relevant index cards placed on them. MOCs will help you overcome the overwhelming anxiety that can arise from having notes scattered everywhere. More on this later.
    - **Other Fluid Frameworks** - Adding structure to your notes has gotten a bad rap lately. But if you know how to keep your frameworks fluid, you'll get the best of both worlds: order __and__ chaos; excellent note retrieval __and__ the serendipity of discovery. More on this later.
