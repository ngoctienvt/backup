- Today is a productive day. When I take a walk, it's the best way for me to practice presence, merge, and evoke creativity. I used to think that I'm good at the abstract conceptual stage but actually it's not, I just got stuck at this more than everyone.
- I also start to see that when training, it's important to guide people through experiences and journey rather than trying to explain to them how good, how fun, how meaningful it is. They will decide by themselves through their own journey, because I can't control how people feel, I can only help them feel the most authentic and helpful way.

- I noticed that it's important for me to let go myself and become the person who truly live to raise the moments up without any personal needs. If I can do this, I can grow infinitely and live meaningfully. The meaning of life is not about proving myself, it's about utilizing and sharpening my potentials to raise the moments up. And the raising of other people or moments are what meaningful for life, not just for me. Because I'm a part of life itself. [raise the moments](<raise the moments.md>)
