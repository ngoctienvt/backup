- The [starting point](<starting point.md>) of everything is established a solidify [basic foundation](<basic foundation.md>) so that I can come back at any time. The role of a basic foundation is to establish a [ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach](<ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach.md>), a broad viewpoint that includes things I want to work on. It would help to set me a [truth compass](<truth compass.md>) to come back when I feel lost or to expand myself based on the experience that I gained. [life flow](<life flow.md>) [ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach](<ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach.md>)
    - The reason to have a [starting point](<starting point.md>) is to realize that things have different levels or different progress to work on. [ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach](<ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach.md>) The starting point is established by 
        - learning and getting used to what's possible, 
        - what's the floor and what's the possible ceiling?
        - what's the meaning of this?
    - After establishing a starting point, the next thing is about the [mastery](<mastery.md>) process. The process of mastery is what's I actually do in the [ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach](<ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach.md>) that I defined. 
        - It's about listing the things that I want to master. The things to master will have different levels as well. 
            - One is to understand the components.
            - Second is to have a synthesis or a goal to use things together. [synthesis](<synthesis.md>)
        - Choose and go deep to acquire a [deeper understanding](<deeper understanding.md>) in each thing [[bottom-up approach
        - Synthesis things by a [ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach](<ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach.md>) that have goals, challenges, application oriented as a result.
        - Reflection after each learning to condense knowledges and experiences. [condensing and generative process](<condensing and generative process.md>)
    - The third step is going beyond.
        - Come back to the foundation and start to [[bottom-up approach things.
