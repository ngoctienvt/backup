- [Vision for the future](<Vision for the future.md>) is truly an interesting part that I learn from Vishen. He taught me that there are 3 types of happiness, end goals and means goals, and 3 things that I can vision to focus my intention on. Before I'm actually doing the exercises, I want to merge them with my spiritual understanding first, so that I can work on it more effectively.
    - The happiness parts are
        - Experiences that we have. This is similar to the facts that there are happiness that me - the witness consciousness - interested to have and experience on my journey on earth, beside all of the experiences that will come to me naturally.
        - Growth - this is similar to the part that I feel so enjoy and better when I can let go and merge, and feel evolve. It's also about the joy of become better on my ability to do certain things on certain areas. It's simply about mastery is the joy itself.
        - Contribution is the part similar to the part of me that want to enjoy the world together with all of my soulmates. I want to help to awake them, raise them up, support them, so that's we all have a good time on earth together. And it's not just for people close to me, but for anyone who want to live a higher life. 
            - My mission somehow is about directly leading people to live a higher life, so that's indirectly, they will support other people and contribute back to the world.
            - We also have a good time together which relates to the experiences that I want to have.
        - It's start to clearer for me after I writing this, so I will consider and make a little bit adjustment for the way I think about my end goals.
- I started to develop my personal mission and my mission for what I want to serve the world. It starts to clearer and my growth start to become more focus and center. This week I will focus about this aspect to direct my attention on.
    - Mission is the guidance for me to aim and go forward. Growth is what I will need to work on, so that I can have enough ability to complete my mission. 
        - And what I have or experiences are the by-products or what will naturally when I focus on my growth and serve my mission. 
- Asking in context is important for support other people thinking processs [Facilitates Client Growth](<Facilitates Client Growth.md>) [Expanding questions](<Expanding questions.md>) [4F Debrief Framework](<4F Debrief Framework.md>)

    - My main realization is context is very important and manage the contexts is an important skill that I need to develop. [contextual management](<contextual management.md>). It's helpful for providing clarity and focus, while it could be expand slowly or dig deeply depend on the direction, so that a person can learn in a much effective way.

        - My [coaching review session](<coaching review session.md>) need to be design based on this principle, so that my clients can harvest the most from our journey. I will work on this tomorrow.
