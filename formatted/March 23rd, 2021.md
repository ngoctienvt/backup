- [true love](<true love.md>) Today I noticed that it is my wrong approach and behaviors that cause the relationship become difficult. I'm naturally relax, carefree, receiving rather than active in relationship. If a relationship requires me to active, there is something wrong, because it will only works on the short-term due to misunderstanding. 
    - It's always better for me to lean back, be myself, and let other people active to come to me, and offer me what they need from me, so that I can serve them without worry, concern, fear too much...
    - Of course some demands are hard to deal with, but it's okay because they need me, so the relationship will continue nurture while I'm paying attention and learning to handle it.
    - In my relationship with Thá»¥c Linh, it's has been wrong that I'm acting through my needs rather than let it happens naturally. And the more I try, the more it stop to work and the more I feel lost and not be myself.
        - In order for it to have the chance to work, I need to tell her the truth, and it's up to her about she will receive it. 
    - The relationship shouldn't one-sided. It's a collaboration and interaction between  2 entities. It's a learning journey.
