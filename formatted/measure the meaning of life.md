It also makes me feel much easier about seeing the world that other people behaviour to me is always the chance for me to grow, and they don't grow at that time. So it's actually the stepping stone for me to go up while they are going down. There is nothing right or wrong, just the truth. Because what's truly important in the end HOW MUCH WE ENJOY, GROW AND SERVE ON THE TIME ON EARTH. Not how high our starting point is, but how much we go so far and how much we contribute as by-products. [measure the meaning of life](<measure the meaning of life.md>)
