- •	Last night [dream](<dream.md>), I noticed my tendency to satisfy my [sexual desire](<sexual desire.md>) by external solutions, but avoid taking [personal responsibilities](<personal responsibilities.md>) with that solutions.
- •	I also realized that I want to learn to let myself integrate every single samskaras that popup without the [need for understanding](<need for understanding.md>) them. I could learn to resolve them after that. [trust the process](<trust the process.md>) [embrace the unknown](<embrace the unknown.md>) [life lessons](<life lessons.md>)
- Today focus:
    - handling fear, sexual desire, releasing attachments
    - handling habit-formed will to check facebook [[staying in
the moment]]
    - condensing [point of focus](<point of focus.md>) [[knowledge development
process]]
    - editing video 6
- [personal responsibilities](<personal responsibilities.md>)
    - I could handle my [sexual desire](<sexual desire.md>) by metaphor my body just
as my bike, I would not pour its problem to other people unconsciously.
Instead, I will learn to handle it by myself first, and only ask for support
when really needed. I respect other people's body as they have no
responsibility for my inner problems and honour their existence for their own's
sake. [honoring](<honoring.md>) [dis-identification](<dis-identification.md>)
    - I also need to learn that whether I'm conscious or
unconscious doing my actions, I need to learn to fully take responsibilities
for the unconscious parts as they are the result of my inability to handle my
own [samskaras](<samskaras.md>) or my own [inner urge](<inner urge.md>). [reaction](<reaction.md>)
- [knowledge development process](<knowledge development process.md>)
    - The way I keep track my personal knowledge through its development process is not fully clear at the moment. [preparing resources](<preparing resources.md>)
        - for collecting raw materials, I feel that it's very important to keep it in a way that I can easily come back to what I haven't resolved yet. My current method is using Resources to keep track of things. But I have the worry when it will become clustering when there are more things. [clustering](<clustering.md>)
        - raw materials would not a perfect name to mention the collection of unresolved input from reading, experience, failing,... [raw data](<raw data.md>) is a better name to relate with.
    - Other is what if there is some knowledge that case-sensitive and I need to do them in a hard-boundary situation instead of merging them to my whole life. [personal knowledge development](<personal knowledge development.md>)
        - I want to able to integrate them and also split them at the same time in a natural way. [natural progression](<natural progression.md>)
        - 2 components: situational interaction and general interaction
            - general is about my daily life
        - while case-sensitive is about some situation that I need to operate in a specific way to complete a certain case-sensitive intention like coaching, training,...
        - so basically general is mainly only me interact with myself or just simply flow to enjoy the experiences [enjoy the learning experience](<enjoy the learning experience.md>)
        - enjoy the learning experience is not truly complete my way of thinking. Because I feel that I still not clear about simply experience and digest the meaning or handle the hard experiences. It kinds of two different process.
        - while case-sensitive is about the interaction between me and the contextual situation of reality, so it's about the second step is [meeting the demand of reality](<meeting the demand of reality.md>) or [interacting with life](<interacting with life.md>)
- [problem-solving process](<problem-solving process.md>) [design for emergence](<design for emergence.md>)
    - write down thoughts and feelings
    - break down the components
    - write to deeper understanding about each component and also
clear the confusion, overlapping between them.
    - the solution emerge as a result from [optimal conditions](<optimal conditions.md>)
- the shift from [exclusion](<exclusion.md>) to [inclusion](<inclusion.md>) attitude is very important because only by inclusion, the thing can become [wholer](<wholer.md>) and simpler at the same time. [integration](<integration.md>).
- I realized that [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>) is not just the fact that the soul evolve by merging with experiences, it's also about the soul able to consciously direct it to [higher intention](<higher intention.md>).
    - For example, when I realize that I don't want to addict to my mind, I wonder then what I want to do instead of that. It requires me to learn to have my own intention to do what instead.
- I still not have a clear [thought process](<thought process.md>) for condensing
thoughts that makes me feel clustering and confusing. I will work more on this.
[compressed process](<compressed process.md>)
- I have a [fear of troubles](<fear of troubles.md>) that make me hard to
compassion and caring for other people in an [helpful manner](<helpful manner.md>).
- I have a [judgment](<judgment.md>) for people who are mostly cared for
themselves only and have thought make me believe that they don't even care
about other people without really checking this first. [perception](<perception.md>)
- [thought process](<thought process.md>) [truth compass](<truth compass.md>) [coaching language](<coaching language.md>) want is an easy to misunderstand word. It's a word that can be soul-guidance or ego-guidance. I want to have a word that making more hard boundary to imply soul-guidance. [generated language](<generated language.md>)
    - So actually it's not really about the word, it's about what state the soul in when receiving the question. [state of being](<state of being.md>) If the state is identified with samskaras, emotions, thoughts, then the answer will reveal these identified objects rather what the soul will want when it's free.
- [tough love](<tough love.md>) I want to develop a [mature](<mature.md>) tough love that fully impersonal and not be attach with any method, solution, desire, but rather base on [compassion](<compassion.md>).
- What I want when finding a centralized messenger system is
    - •	contextual approach for different usage instead of many groups of different people now
    - •	centralized information
    - •	easy to access and check with - link to the existing messenger or email is also good for important notifications
    - •	building from a [[bottom-up approach
    - •	contextual approach for different usage instead of many group of different people now [contextual usages](<contextual usages.md>)
    - •	[centralized information](<centralized information.md>)
    - •	easy to access and check with - link to the existing messenger or email is also good for important notifications [bridging](<bridging.md>)
    - what I concern about slack is losing old messages and not easy to bridge.
        - for file or document sharing, it would be good to store them no google drive or notions
        - for bridging, it's possible if there is a way to notify everyone on the channel.

- I have a bit [attachment with money](<attachment with money.md>) when I need to pay
for things that I don't pay usually, especially if it subscribes for a long
time. The reason is I'm not sure that will I really use it and fear that I
won't able to sustain it for long term. [living in the future](<living in the future.md>)
    - Instead of that, I could just simply define what I really
need right now, and is it serve it? Not what I think I could have, but what I
will actually use. [abundance appreciation](<abundance appreciation.md>)
    - I'm spending my effort to create a mind-training course with
progressive approach.
    - Tiago Forte posts really stimulate me the deep knowledge
that it will take a long time for me to develop on my own.
    - 10$ subscribe is worth it as a content of a book. But now is
many articles instead.
    - I also can use Evernote if I want to store articles that I
haven't able to digest on the 1 month period, and don't need to pay next.
    - I will feel much freer if I focus on what it will really
serve me instead of the fear that comes from comparison and greedy by my ego.
