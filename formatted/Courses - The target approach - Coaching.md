- ## 2 key concepts
    - ### The concept of "partnering" with your client
        - shoulder-to-shoulder, not hierarchical relationship
        - "partnering" is the concept for three core competencies
            - [Establishes and Maintains Agreements](<Establishes and Maintains Agreements.md>)
            - [Cultivates trust and safety](<Cultivates trust and safety.md>)
            - [Facilitates Client Growth](<Facilitates Client Growth.md>)
        - Two types of partnering
            - "process" partnering with client for
                - overall coaching agreement
                - each coaching session
                    - Where are you now?
                    - Where do you want to be?
                    - How do you want to close the gap?
            - partnering as a coaching mindset of "keep the spotlight on the client"
                - help clients draw out their self-knowledge, instead of bringing our knowledge
                - invites them to share their experience or generate their own ideas
                - partners them to transform their learning and insight into action
    - ### Disctinctions between "who" versus "what" coaching
        - start to recognize clients as a human being
        - Bigger Who: Coaching client on their
            - Vision
            - Life Purpose
            - Ideal/Future Self
        - Little Who: Coaching the "everyday moment by moment self" of the client
            - Notices emotions, energy shifts, non-verbal cues...
            - Integrates to uunderstand fully what is being communicated
            - explore their way of thinking, values, needs, wants, and beliefs patterns of behaviors, thinking or emotions
        - Bigger What: Coaching "client ideal situation"
        - Little What: Coaching the "everday moment by moment situation" of the client
    - Example of who versus what focus
        - Scenario: your client says they have too much to do and are overwhelemed with projects and tasks.
        - A “What” focus is on (thing - problems)
            - better organization methods, 
            - external focus on others to learn from, 
            - and/or how to approach from a logical or systematic perspective.
        - A “Who” focus is on (relationship with things)
            - the client **relationship** to overwhelm,
            - which is an internal experience and self-given description of how a person feels about how much they have to do. 
            - What’s the cause of their overwhelm?
- The 8 core competencies can be divided into 3 categories:
