## [September 23rd, 2020](<September 23rd, 2020.md>)
- I realized I used to base my love on the lack of inner love, the [personal needs](<personal needs.md>). I want to change this to an attitude that I completely responsible for my [personal needs](<personal needs.md>) and [inner love](<inner love.md>).

-  If I have a chance to come back the time I'm with Ki·ªÅu, I would like to learn to responsible for my [inner love](<inner love.md>)

## [true love](<true love.md>)
- containing and sharing the [inner love](<inner love.md>)
