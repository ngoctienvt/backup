- ## Course introduction
    - In 1971, at age 22, Michael moved out into the woods where The Temple of the Universe sits today. **At that time in his life, Michael did not know how to surrender, or even what surrender was.**
    - Using the events in the outside world that were unfolding before him—his relationships, his business interactions, his personal experiences—**Michael eventually learned how to get out of his own way and, ultimately, embrace the art of surrender.** He has now created this online course for you to do the same.
    - After the Course Introduction, we will share some of the specifics related to the design and structure of the course, what you can expect, and our recommendations for how to move through the course.
    - Let’s begin the journey into living a life of surrender.
- ## Session 1 - Who am I
    - ### Introduction
        - The **first step in learning how to surrender** is to **understand who in there is doing the surrendering.** The world and our thoughts are **so distracting** that it is **difficult to attain clarity of self.** It turns out that the question “Who am I?” is very deep. In this session, we will explore who we are and what our relationship is to our thoughts, emotions, and the outside world. Things may not be as they seem. 
        - **Are you ready to take an objective look within?**
    - ### Lessons 
        - [Who am I](<Who am I.md>) [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>)  In the first lecture, Michael Singer taught that who we really are? He proved that my body is not me through various examples. 
            - First, spiritual growth is realizing that there is an object that I am looking at. Second, there is an act of paying attention to it. Third, realizing that I am the one who is looking, not the one I am looking at. [self-awareness](<self-awareness.md>)
            - [surrender](<surrender.md>) is not about giving up the world, but let go of the part inside of me that are not living the truth. [surrender](<surrender.md>) is remember that I'm always the one who is looking and anything I can look is not myself, but the object that I'm looking at. [wisdom](<wisdom.md>) [letting go](<letting go.md>)
            - I am the [witness conscious](<witness conscious.md>). I have the ability to project my consciousness and my attention to other objects. However, I am easy to lose myself and [pay attention](<pay attention.md>) too much into the objects that I'm very hard to pay attention to what I am doing, and to come back to pay attention to myself. 
            - I am also easy to [identify](<identify.md>) myself with other objects and forget that I can't be hurt because I don't have a body. I can feel hurt, but this is just an experience that I feel temporarily when I connect with my body, but "I" can't be hurt, because I am not having body.
            - I also don't look at things outside, I look at them inside, but my mind render it in a way that cover entire of my vision, so it makes me feel like I am looking at things outside, because there is no black edge around makes me realize that I am looking at it inside. [mind rendering](<mind rendering.md>)
            - I'm inside and I experience 3 main things:
                - The world outside that comes into my consciousness through my body senses.
                - The thoughts created by the mind.
                - The emotions that emerged from the heart.
            - I also not used to disconnect external things, so I am easy to distract by them. And because I tend to distract by them, so it's hard for me to [resist the urge](<resist the urge.md>) to focus on them and focus on myself instead. Because they are much more [interesting](<interesting.md>) and easy to focus on instead of me. [distraction](<distraction.md>)
            - So if I want to focus back on myself: [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>)
                - I need to remove distraction so the less the distraction is, the easier I can focus on myself.
                - I need to learn to [resist the urge](<resist the urge.md>) that make me [pay attention](<pay attention.md>) to the [object of consciousness](<object of consciousness.md>) to practice [willpower](<willpower.md>) to withdraw my attention to the [seat of consciousness](<seat of consciousness.md>). 
            - The [nature of being](<nature of being.md>) is beautiful, no form, no physical body, easy to distract, and identify with the object of consciousness. When the [witness consciousness](<witness consciousness.md>) identified itself with the other things, it feels the nature of that thing instead of itself. 
            - When I comeback to become a "witness consciousness", I will realize that the [nature of being](<nature of being.md>) is not what I used to identify with, and I will realize that my mind can have problems and the things that come to me can make me feel it as a problem, but I am is beautiful, enough, and powerful than ever thing that come to me. 
    - ### Summary
        - In this session, Michael explained that the first step in learning how to surrender is to understand and know who you are. So, who are you? In other words, **do you realize that you are the being** who is in there, **aware of your thoughts, emotions, and the outside world**?
        - We learned **you are not what you look at,** but rather, you are **the one who is looking**. This is called your **seat of awareness**. You are always aware, **you are always conscious**—even in deep sleep, you are in there, aware.
        - **The problem** is **we don’t experience life from that place of awareness.** Throughout our lives, **we have been lost** in our outside world—the people, the places, the things, and the experiences—as well as in our thoughts and emotions, **all in an attempt to make ourselves be and feel OK.** When we **learn to center back** into the seat of awareness, **we will find ourselves, and we can begin the path of surrender.**
    - ### Reflecting questions
        - Were you able to relate to Michael when he spoke about hearing the voice talking inside his head as he sat on the couch with his friend? If so, describe what it’s like to just notice your mind is talking.
        - If you are aware that you are in there, what’s it like in there? For example, is it a nice place to be, or is it a messy place to be? What does it feel like on a day-to-day basis? Would you actually allow someone else to see what’s going on in there?
        - Michael explained that awareness is the subject, and the things you experience outside, including your own mind and heart, are simply objects you are aware of. Can you relate to your heart and mind being something you are simply aware of? Describe your experience of what it is like being able to keep your distance, versus getting drawn into them.
        - As we learned in Session One, the first step to surrender is to notice you are in there. If you were able to pull back from behind the world of experience, thoughts, and emotions, were you able to catch a brief glimpse of how beautiful you truly are? What did it feel like?
        - Do you or do you not want to know what is beyond you?
- ## Session 2 - the outside world
    - ### Introduction
        - As we enter Session Two,** you are now aware that you are in there.** You are not your thoughts, your emotions, or the reflection you see in the mirror—you are the one who is looking. We have called this your seat of awareness.
        - From this seat of awareness, **you look out** into the world, watch your thoughts, and feel your emotions. **These are all objects of consciousness, **but **where did they come from?** Perhaps** if you understood this better,** you would be **more comfortable accepting them as they are.** 
        - **Acceptance is a major step in surrender.** In this session, we will explore some very fundamental questions: 
            - What is the outside world, 
            - where did it come from, 
            - and what is your actual relationship to it?
    - ### Lessons
        - [the outside world](<the outside world.md>) [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>) In session 2, Michael Singer taught me the truth about the reality that they are created by itself which independent with myself.
            - Is the [moment](<moment.md>) in front of me is the only moment in the universe?
            - Where does the moment in front of me coming from?
            - What makes me not okay with the moment that are giving to me?
            - The [training method](<training method.md>) of Michael Singer is teaching students from a [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>) that starts with what's the truth, proving it and linking it slowly to the understanding of students. It creates conflict and separation in the mind of the students between the perception and the absolute truth. 
            - Due to this, students can start to learn to let go of the untruth, so they can realize what's left. The truth is always there, it didn't need you to agree that it's true or create your perception about it. It just needs us to open and aware its existence. [absolute truth](<absolute truth.md>) [perception](<perception.md>) [existence](<existence.md>)
    - ### Summary
        - In Session One, you became aware that you are in there. It should be easy to see this, but typically **we focus on what is happening in there**—**instead of the fact that we are actually in there.** You are not your thoughts, your emotions, or the reflection you see in the mirror—you are the one who is looking.
        - **But what exactly is it that you are experiencing in there?**
        - There is always a moment unfolding in front of you. As we learned in this session, **the moment in front of you has nothing to do with you;** it just **happens to be where you are looking at that moment in time.** The moment in front of you has been in the making for **13.8 billion years and has now arrived** on your doorstep.** The moment does not belong to you, and it is not personal.** The moment in front of you s**imply asked you to participate in the dance that is taking place;** it did **not ask you to like it or dislike it.**
        - **Where did the moment in front of you come from?** Our scientists have studied in great detail where the universe and every atom within it came from. It is truly remarkable! We learn that **the present moment is the perfect result of all prior events in creation.** Since every event that takes place is the result of every single thing that ever happened, you get to experience the miracle of creation every single moment of your life. **When you wake up to the miracle of the moment, you begin to perceive every moment as special and holy.**
        - Whether you are on a conference call at work, studying for an exam in the school library, or cleaning your kitchen floor at home, **the moment in front of you is constantly asking you to participate in the dance of life.** The moment asked you to call that person on the phone, engage with the study materials, and pick up the mop. 
        - [inner clarity](<inner clarity.md>) is about **waking up to both the reality and the miracle of the moment.** 
            - It is** realizing the moment in front of you would exist with or without you,** 
            - and **at the same time, understanding that engaging with the moment allows you to step into the flow of the universe.**
    - ### Reflecting questions
        - Are you able to recognize the holiness of the moment in front of you? Please describe a moment you recently experienced that you now see as holy, whereas before you might have overlooked it. For example: watching it rain, waking up in the morning, eating an apple, overhearing your neighbors argue in the middle of the night, meeting with someone at work about a project, or waiting at the bus stop with strangers.
        - Next time you catch yourself taking the moment in front of you personally, are you willing to step back and put it in perspective? For example, at work, your boss chooses someone else’s idea instead of yours. Explain how meaningful this looks in relation to the planet Earth spinning through empty space.
        - A lot was covered in this session. What was your biggest takeaway?
- ## Session 3 - The mind, part 1
    - ### Introduction
        - So far in the course, we have stressed the fact that you are in there experiencing what passes before you. **We discovered that the moment unfolding in front of you took 13.8 billion years to get here, and it is not personal.** You did not create the moment—it was given to you and you alone.** Each moment is a unique gift.**
        - Now we will begin to **explore another thing you are aware of:** **the mind.** As we’ve learned, you are not the mind; you are simply aware of the mind. The **human mind is truly amazing**—it is brilliant and creative, and yet **at the same time, it can be the source of great personal suffering and pain.** **To be free of this pain, we must understand the mind.** 
    - ### Lessons
    - ### Summary
        - In this session, we will learn 
            - what the mind is, 
            - where it came from, 
            - and why it creates the thoughts it does.
        - In this session, we began to explore the mind. We learned that the p**ure mind is a field of energy that creates thoughts** that you, the consciousness, are aware of. **The mind also receives and renders the world that comes in through the senses. **It** allows you to experience the outside world** and **to learn and grow from that experience. **
        - The **problem is that the mind creates an alternate reality out of thoughts.** It is **built of the impressions you stored from past experiences** you **either liked and tried to keep**** or could not handle and pushed away.** These stored impressions create what Michael calls **the personal mind.**
        - Based on your stored impressions, **you created a specific directive** as to **how the world in front of you needs to unfold** in order for you to feel good. **This alternate, mental reality prevents you from experiencing true reality,** and it ultimately causes you extreme suffering throughout your life. 
        - Caught in this fabricated world of thoughts, **you are no longer able to see the truth of life** **because your past personal experiences are prejudicing your mind. **Your past likes and dislikes are distorting your perception of the present moment unfolding before you. This further contributes to the building of the personal mind.
        - **Does it have to be this way?**** Ideally, the moment comes in, and you learn from it—both comfortable and uncomfortable. **You let the moment pass through you. **Letting moments pass through you is the act of surrender.**
        - **Surrender is the highest path because** it says, **“I want to experience who I truly am, not who I think I am.”** The **whole of spiritual growth** is **getting comfortable with all moments—the good and the bad.** When you are able to do this, you will begin to become free.
    - ### Reflection questions
        - In this session, we explored how the personal mind is built. After watching this session, are you able to distinguish the difference between personal thoughts and impersonal thoughts? Describe what you understand to be the difference.
        - How does the world in front of you need to unfold in order for you to feel good? Can you see that you have modeled it all within your mind? Can you see that this limits what will make you happy to the things you have decided you want? What would it be like to expand your comfort zone to include more of life?
        - In this session, we talked about “mind-blowing experiences.” We have mind-blowing experiences when we are able to center our consciousness on the experience we are having in front of us. Are you able to describe a recent experience where your mind was blown?
        - While hiking, the experience of spotting a coiled rattlesnake with a flickering rattle on your path is very different from the experience of a monarch butterfly landing on your arm during the same hike. As we learned in this session, every single thing that comes in is supporting your evolution, even a rattlesnake. Looking back, is there an experience in your own life that at the time upset you, but now on reflection, supporting you in becoming a better version of yourself today?
        - What are two experiences that you’ve had in your life that you feel left an impression on you, and now run your life? For example, you were bitten by a dog at the park when you were eight years old, and since then have avoided dogs your entire life. Or, you grew up in a beautiful town with redwoods and rivers, and now only dream of returning and settling down in a similar place like the beautiful town in which you once lived.
- ## Session 4 - The mind, part 2
    - ### Introduction
        - In this session, we continue the exploration of the mind and how to come to peace with it. We will learn that although we can willfully generate thoughts, most of the time we hear incessant personal chatter going on all by itself. Where do all those thoughts come from, and are they actually increasing or diminishing our chance for happiness?
    - ### Lessons
    - ### Summary
        - In this session, we continued the exploration of the mind. We learned that **if you use the personal mind to decide life is supposed to be a certain way**—the way you want—**you will continually suffer.** In truth, **the cause of suffering is not the way things are in life,** but that **you decide how you want life to be,** and **life does not go that way.** Manipulating the outside world to fit our stored stuff will** never work**, and **this is why the personal mind is so fearful.**
        - What do you imagine your life would look like **if you could experience the moment unfolding before you** **without the interference of the personal mind?**
        - **However, the mind is also a gift.** You have the same mind that discovered the atom, created the computer, or figured out E=MC2. You can run a business, write a book, or send a spaceship to the moon with this aspect of the mind. Like a computer, a blank blackboard, or an empty piece of paper, **your mind is the playground** in which you have **free will to create any thoughts you’d like.**
        - During this session, we examined the constant chatter of the voice inside your head. **Where does this voice in your head come from? **As we learned, when an experience unfolding in front of you presents itself and you resist it, **you are actually resisting the energy of the experience** and, as a result, **you capture the energy impression** deep inside of you. **These impressions you’ve stored** inside are **determining most of the thoughts** you are having right now. **These thoughts will continually occur until the stored impressions are able to pass through.**
    - ### Reflection questions
        - Have you ever had a dream that was obviously your mind releasing the stored energy of a past experience? What stored energy do you feel your dream was trying to release? Have you released that energy or is it still blocked in there?
        - What have you used your abstract or intellectual mind to create in your life? For example, you run a business, you play a musical instrument, you are a writer, you are taking this course.
        - We learned there is a lot of chatter happening on its own in the mind, and that chatter is the result of the impressions we’ve stored inside. Most of the time, we are so absorbed in these thoughts that we don’t even notice the mind is doing this. What does the voice inside your head sound like? What things does it talk to you about or tell you to do?
        - What do you imagine your life would look like if you could experience the moment unfolding before you without the interference of the personal mind?
- ## Session 5 - The spiritual heart
    - ### Introduction
        - In this session, we continue to peel back the layers of the psyche by exploring the heart. We will learn what the heart is and why it creates the emotions it does. We will also explore how the heart becomes so sensitive and blocked that it is difficult to live with. Given all of this, is it really possible to become comfortable with all the emotions and energies the heart creates? After all, coming to peace with your heart is a prerequisite to true surrender.
    - ### Lessons
    - ### Summary
        - By this point, it is clear that you are in there. You are aware of the world that is unfolding in front of you and that it has nothing to do with you. If you were not there, it would still unfold. You are also conscious of the thoughts created by your mind. These thoughts can be willfully created. However, much of the time they are really just happening on their own.
        - In this session, we continued to **peel back the layers of the psyche** by **focusing on the heart.** We learned that the **heart is an energy center,** and it is **very sensitive.** We saw that much is stored in the heart—including **the stuff you shoved out of your mind** from the past (samskaras). You are not your thoughts, and so too, you are not your emotions. **You are the experiencer of the emotions emanating from your heart.**
        - As you **learn to become established in the seat of Self,** you will start to be **able to quietly relax as the emotions pass through** your heart. 
            - **If you resist in the slightest,** you will have to struggle with these emotions. 
            - **If you do not resist,** you will **provide the room needed** for the stored energies to be released.
        - We saw that **surrender** is **the willingness to let go of the tendency** to **either resist the surfacing of these energies** **or to allow them to release their discomfort outwardly.**
        - **If you just inwardly relax and release,** these **energies from the heart will naturally rise upward** towards your higher energy centers. Over time, **this upward flow will fill you with a sense of being** fed from within. You will experience a constant flow of love, joy, and total well-being as your heart becomes purified.
    - ### Reflection questions
        - Have you ever had the experience of your heart suddenly opening, and as a result, you changed your entire life? How does this help you see how powerful the heart is?
        - In this past week, have you witnessed any of your stuff getting hit and all the discomfort you felt in your heart? If so, how did you react? For example, did you react and then later realize that you could have been centered and dealt with it differently? Or were you able to witness your stuff being hit and be OK with that?
        - In our interaction with the outside world, if a physical object comes too close, we instinctively put our hands up to protect ourselves. Can you see that we do the same thing inside with uncomfortable energies emanating from the heart? Can you imagine what it would be like to relax and allow the energies to pass through? What is stopping you?
- ## Session 6 - The predicament and the spiritual path
    - ### Introduction
        - In this session, we more fully explore the stored energy patterns from the past (samskaras) that are running your life. Michael explains in detail how these patterns are created and the difficulties they cause. What would happen if you decided to free yourself of these past patterns instead of using life to compensate for them? Once you start becoming serious about your inner work, you will begin to understand the power of a life of surrender.
    - ### Lessons
    - ### Summary
        - As we have already learned, we have stored patterns inside, which are called samskaras. These patterns are based upon past experiences that we did not let go of, and as a result, they were not able to pass through us. Instead, we either resisted the moment because we did not like it, or we clung to the moment because we did like it. You did this with your own free will.
        - In this session, we **explored the dynamics of these stored energy patterns and showed how they run your life.** Michael describes this as the predicament we find ourselves in.
        - **Your mind uses its power of imagination** to create situations and experiences that fit your stored patterns, all **in an attempt to make you feel better.** Basically, you are **either trying to match the energy patterns** you stored inside because it feels better, **or you are attempting to do the opposite and avoid the energy patterns** stored inside. Either way, **whether you are for or against them, these stored patterns are running your life. **This again, is what is meant by the predicament.
        - We **continue to distract ourselves from ourselves** with new houses, new jobs, new cities, and new relationships **because we are not OK inside. **We try to solve our inner problems with outer things. However, **as we learned, these are inner problems, and therefore they can only be solved inside.**
        - **You have a choice:** **every single moment of your life**
            - is either about getting what you want, 
            - or **letting go of the part of you** that is keeping you from being OK. 
            - Getting what you want is not going to make you permanently OK. However, you will always be OK if you let go of what is making you think you need something.
        - **Letting go of the blockages and cleaning out your patterns will set you free.** You free yourself to experience the moment unfolding in front of you, instead of defining what that moment needs to be for you to be OK.
        - Your entire life changes **when you decide to no longer live for your personal self**, and instead let go of it. When you do this, **your life becomes about the inner energy flow that is set free.** This is the spiritual path. In this session, we began to learn how to live this spiritual path—a life of surrender.
    - ### Reflection questions
- ## Session 7 - Learning to let go
    - ### Introduction
        - True spiritual growth is not about getting anything—it is always about letting go. In this session, we will learn that letting go is the highest spiritual path there is. You are absolutely capable of completely freeing yourself from what has you locked in the limits of your habitual thoughts. Michael shows us clear techniques and practices for letting go of what is keeping us from deep inner liberation.
