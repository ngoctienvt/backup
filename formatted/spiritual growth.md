- Last night, I have a dream that I got [angry](<angry.md>) and released my angry into other people.

## [September 19th, 2020](<September 19th, 2020.md>)
- I felt that I still tended to defend and protect myself. I am still easy to get trigger by other people and didn't come in with reality with a neutral attitude yet. I want to learn to be able to [unattachment](<unattachment.md>) myself with everything related to me, even my creation, my writing, my ideas... These "mine" possessiveness are just the product of clinging tendency, but there are no such things that really "mine".

- I feel that I still have too many [personal needs](<personal needs.md>) to control others based on the attachment with my ideas of what's right or wrong when I interacted with Hương and Thảo. I iI want to release all the unattachment even with the things that I feel are right and better. Even if it's true, the importance is not the truth, but to support others in a [helpful manner](<helpful manner.md>) to live the truth. Because the truth is standing for itself, there is no need to defense for it, it's just my [personal needs](<personal needs.md>) [unattachment](<unattachment.md>) [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>)

- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) I felt pretty surprised but not too much when Linh asked me for help. I knew that she seems strong outside, but she also has a strong identification with the physical world. And now, they are gone, so she is under a big lesson for her spiritual growth. I realized that I always want to support her, though some thoughts about the romantic relationship still pop-up in my head. I want to release all those possessive thoughts and support her with the cleanest heart and mind as possible. [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>)
