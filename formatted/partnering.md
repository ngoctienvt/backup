- I am learning to not put the truth into other head, but rather be a falictitator that provide space and guidance, so that we can explore and learn together. I'm not an instructor, but rather a part of the group. I'm not teaching, but rather a facilitator and learner at the same time. This is partnerning growth. [partnering](<partnering.md>)
