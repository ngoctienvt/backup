- [true relationship](<true relationship.md>) is what I will focus on and it is not any person-oriented or type of relationship oriented. It's not about [true love](<true love.md>) that we tend to see as the romantic relationship between two person. 

[true relationship](<true relationship.md>) is about the relationship between people and people, without any sexual desires, personal needs, and expectations. It's the relationship that we are share our life, our challenges, our wisdom, and support each other on the time on earth. We have time to have fun with each other, merge between two hearts.

        - To help people navigate themselves to move up abstract or move down concrete thinking.
    - [instructional design](<instructional design.md>) need to consider how to support a person to move up and move down these level of thinking, so the goal of the course is completed.
