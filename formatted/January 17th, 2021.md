    - It seems like I have a lot of experiences this week. I learned so much more things about myself.
    - The highlight of the week is 
        - I start to less feel restless and able to handle this more. 
        - I also start to work on my intention, this is the most important part that will hold me on the right track, and influence my development in a significant way.
    - My focus for next week [üéØFocus of the week](<üéØFocus of the week.md>)
    - I feel so grateful that I have all the support needed to have me grow and become better each day. I also feel grateful about myself for commit to do what I believe is good for me, and trust on myself. I also feel grateful that the universe is helping people around me. Everything is not needed to be my responsibilities on me only, it's the illusion of my ego.
- I noticed that I still easy to have preferences for object of consciousness. Some objects make me feel good and I like that feelings. Some objects that I feel hard to handle need to be handle so that I won't be influence or control by it any more. [deliberate practice](<deliberate practice.md>)
    - The path to comeback to myself is not easy but simple. The point is it requires practice I grow myself to the point that I am stronger or higher than them. It's just like I know that I can walk doesn't mean that I can do it easily. It requires practice to be able to do that. And the practices will take time, effort, and even the good strategy for each different stage. 
        - All I need to know is aware the state I am at, and develop a strategy to practice, and just keep practices until I come to the next level, or grow naturally.
    - The point of becoming is actually not about achieving something external, it's about growing me to the point that I become that and can totally handle anything that makes me not that.
- I still have a hard time to close my thinking process and focus on truly experience in the deepest way.
    - I noticed that 2 things I want will be different steps of my work [üß≠Productivity System MOC](<üß≠Productivity System MOC.md>)
        - Always have happiness, fulfillment, joy need me to focus on truly experiences by merging and letting go. Being a watcher, a witness conscious to know what happen. To truly simply see things rather than identify with things. [witness consciousness](<witness consciousness.md>)
        - The second step for making this life better is about conceptualize my knowledge, able to explain it in human language, form them to concepts or framework that could act as a mean or a way, a bridge to support other people. [bridging](<bridging.md>) [means](<means.md>)
        - And also the actual execution. This will be the mix of both, it's about serving the world the best as I can, but it's also about me having another experience to grow myself into.
- I noticed that in order to know what's the right thing? It's very complicated and hard, because it will require try and learn. So it would be far more better if we know what's the wrong thing to do? And as long as we try and test outside of that zone, we are safe to grow. [zone of growing](<zone of growing.md>)
    - For instance, as a coach, instead of having the right questions to ask
        - It's better to let coach know what's the inappropriate questions, intentions, sources of questions, so that they can question their experiences and learn from that. 
            - It's not about doing things right, it's about ability to learn to do better continuously when we fall to the below thing.
            - It's not about always on the right track. It's about noticing how we get off track and learn from that, so that we can get back on the right track more often. [on the right track](<on the right track.md>)
- [Having experiences](<Having experiences.md>) 
    - For reading or absorbing experience, it felt not clear about how I will process in this stage. As sometimes, I feel that some materials are not needed to dig too much deep and it will very time-consuming and not effective.
        - I need to have a clear boundary about how to handle the important materials and the materials that I can just experience or just simply take some notes about my thougths/ my insights and don't need to process more.
        - The important materials are 
            - Books that directly related to what I want to master and have a lot of knowledges that I need to conceptualize and digest.
            -  Important concepts or knowledges that take time to digest
                - Frameworks
                - Principles/ rules
            - These knowledges are the foundation map of knowledge that will help me to build up or expand my expertise in a significant way.
        - The not-need-to-process-many-times materials
            - Movies/ Films
            - Short knowledge blog post
            - Knowledge that compliment my internal knowledges
            - These things I just need to take some notes when I already have my own inner knowledge system to fill them in.
    - How I will process in this stage is also a big question
        - I don't want to finish based on the constraint of the tools, like I have to finish a book, finish a long program...
        - I feel that I want to focus base on what's the goal or an inner system that I want to develop first, and then develop them into a hierachial system rather than let them just be a spread non-hierachial and not linked knowledge. [deep connection](<deep connection.md>)
- Methods/ tools/ techniques are means that what the mind think that they will help the mind to achieve something. And the most important of growth is clarify what something is, rather than losing on the tools and methods. [means](<means.md>) [üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth](<üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth.md>) [true growth](<true growth.md>) [intentional](<intentional.md>) or purposeful
- I noticed that I feel so disturb when I think that something I want to achieve may not be achieve. I still have some preferences and personal needs related to board game or physical stuffs. I need to work more on this.
- I feel that my way of looking about coaching need to be redefine. And this is where I could start to bridge the gap between coaching and meditation. I will learn how a professional coach help a human being go through a coaching session. [bridging](<bridging.md>)
    - Through this I could debrief what happened to help me understand more about the meaning of coaching and how it‚Äôs affacted that human being. Then I can transfer them again how coaching affect to a soul that have a human experience.
- I noticed that I feel fun when I‚Äôm able to talk with My Linh. I‚Äôm learning to care about her for her sake only. I care how she is now, what challenges she has, what experiences she‚Äôs having now, what her concern, care about, and how I can share the joy, the fun of life with her, or support her when she need the support. [@Nguy·ªÖn M·ªπ Linh](<@Nguy·ªÖn M·ªπ Linh.md>)
- I feel that I‚Äôm starting to able to see things more impersonal way and this is very important for me to ground myself on, and not be shake by other people beliefs, actions, talks, perceptions, judgements,... [üå±Unshakable Centering](<üå±Unshakable Centering.md>)
- I also decide to give Ngoc my money, even though I have a fear that it won‚Äôt comeback to me. But I decide to take this as a chance to let go of my personal parts and my attachments with money. It‚Äôs also a new way that I‚Äôm experimenting with life about trust. I will put my trust on the process and learn to help others selflessly and learn to be more generous as I already receive to much from my life. [generosity](<generosity.md>) [trust the process](<trust the process.md>)
    - I also trust that money is not everything, and life will also support me what I need, so I don‚Äôt need to have any fear about. I just need to trust the universe and do my best job to grow exponentially to handle every life situations that happen to me, instead of living as a victim or a bad learner.
- I feel grateful that I become better day by day. I can learn to experience life, so that‚Äôs life is challenging but exciting, satisfying at the same time.
