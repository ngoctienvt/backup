- I feel that my mind is still unclear and distracting, I don't know what I need to focus on at the moment or what I need to resolve, and how to resolve it now. For example, I need to work on the plane MOC to clear about how I will execute the pilot, but I don't know clearly what I want here, what I need to resolve, and how to relate them to each other. I will need to have a meditation about this.
- I noticed that I get stuck because some of the small things has not process properly yet, and I'm trying to work on the big tasks at once, that's making me feel stress and hard to focus.
