        - Purpose of session 1: 
            - get used to know each other
            - get used to tools - Jamboard and Zoom
            - doing activities to have a big picture about design workshop and survey student needs
        - How sesion flow
            - While You Wait activities
            - Getting used to Jamboard activities
                - Purpose
                    - Gain-attention activity to help ice-breaking [gain-attention](<gain-attention.md>)
                    - Interact to each other 
                    - Ensure everyone can use tools
                    - Help students learn to use different features of tools through activities
                        - For example
                            - Getting used to create sticky notes
                            - Getting used to interact with each other on a Jamboard page
                            - Getting used to workshop and keywords
            - Introduce yourself and get to know facilitators activities
                - This is an indirect activities to introduce facilitators. It reduces one-way interaction
                - Grouping to different people to have a narrow and deeper interaction to each other
            - What is the similarities between design a workshop and design a house?
                - Grouping
                - Request to gather to only 3 visible similarities
                    - It requires students to think in higher level (understand, compare, a bit of analytic and evaluate)
                - Metaphor question is to help guide students start to think about design a workshop - guided thinking
                    - If students are required to discuss steps to design a workshop, the gap of thinking will be too big.
                    - Start with level understand and compare first.
                - These activities are [guided thinking](<guided thinking.md>) activities to help students level up their thinking slowly
            - 5 steps to design a workshop activity
                - Group people to 4 groups, discuss and summarize 5 steps to design a workshop
                - [steps activities](<steps activities.md>)
                    - Request students to list specific number of steps to complete certain tasks based on students' own experience.
                - For content that have process and steps, this activity help to survey how everyone is doing.
                - Purpose
                    - Survey the level of students
                    - Bring out a standard process
                - Everyone will group what discussed to become 5 steps and introduce steps if neccessary.
                - Grouping again to discuss more details on each step
                    - Note:
                        - For big group, a limit number of step is helpful to focus 
                        - For small group, number of step could be flexible for creativity
                - These steps can be teach one-way very fast, but there will lack of interaction, and students will feel hard to understand and remember.
                    - By interacting and creating their own content, they will remember better.
                    - This is called "[generative-instructional strategy](<generative-instructional strategy.md>)" instead of [supplantive-instructional strategy](<supplantive-instructional strategy.md>)".
                        - [Flow model](<Flow model.md>)
                            - Balance between provide knowledge and guidance practices
                            - ![Csikszentmihalyi’s 3-channel flow model ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jon_Pearce/publication/251772214/figure/fig1/AS:298183650496516@1448103930761/Csikszentmihalyis-3-channel-flow-model.png)
            - Write down questions to dig deep activity
                - An activity to help students guide their learning process
                    - It's a need survey and evaluate right from the beginning.
                    - From these questions, facilitators can adjust program properly, and help students prime their mind to focus.
                - Number of questions are 5 and group into steps of design a wokshop
                    - This is a analytic thinking level
                - The way to link activities are 
                    - results of above activities are input or foundation the next activities.
            - What principles needed for a workshop activity
                - Listing and choosing activities
            - Introduce workshop activity
                - It's not necessary to introduce the program at the beginning.
                - It should be introduce when participants have some knowledge about the program.
            - Completing sentences acitivities
                - Completing 2 sentences in group chat
                    - Today I feel...
                    - In this program, I will focus on... to...
                - Purpose
                    - It helps participants to focus into what's matter and valuable
        - Overall note
            - A online workshop will require more interactions than offline workshop, because participants will be distract easier.
            - The process to survey needs will not only occur before, but inside the activities of workshop
                - This is call "hidden agenda" of that activity
            - Design a workshop should have some backup activities if there is enough time.
- Session 2 - Identify goal of a workshop
    - [https://jamboard.google.com/d/12MlhfRKAwpCZAxRca4JiJje67jyszd8JMttRJq16Df0/edit?usp=sharing](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjamboard.google.com%2Fd%2F12MlhfRKAwpCZAxRca4JiJje67jyszd8JMttRJq16Df0%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing%26fbclid%3DIwAR3aker-XNm0OWSSjfzuRdwzBTN0PqZ3Ov3t2qJpoBM_DLwMBDeO-7caPaU&h=AT06Jqi9PThd74YI75ZX8WvV0bLcvdYpME4dgQDsZ3WaWJxDCRGo8pRo5ZfqARAu_K_o_fB7EXf1Uub957f3iRqTbSMV01s6ht4sTqRmhxK7ASqmIoIp6xR08aCunQmL7gtNxQ)
    - Flow of session 2
- Session 3 - Tasks analysis
    - Tasks analysis is identify tasks that participant need to do in certain steps
    - Tasks they need to do different with tasks we teach
    - Working with SME
        - Procedural Analysis
        - Topical Analysis - abstract topic
        - Incident - specific case
    - Mục tiêu
        - List bước thành công nhỏ để đạt mục tiêu
            - List bước cần làm để đạt thành công nhỏ (bước nhỏ cuối cùng, không thể chia nhỏ hơn)
                - Phương thức thực hiện
    - Đào sâu những gì người học còn thắc mắc
        - Xác định điều họ còn thắc mắc
            - Review lại nội dung học

        - https://jamboard.google.com/d/1XR-dnZ1L_VqcMQgZR9f6Ch7isSpXQbcnK6zSLxRvASM/edit?usp=sharing
        - Tasks analysis is list down everything a person need to do to complete a major goal, in a reality scenario - not classom. 
            - The list down process will focus on the participant, not focus on what the trainer will teach.
        - "Boil egg" activities
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BV5EMnpXf7cVWR3gdm9NMgUIby1XNxMYOUoDjAVQULA/edit?usp=sharing
            - 6- Boil egg activities - demo activites
                - Use pictures to let participants choice, so that they will have a feeling of free-choice and will more engage.
                - Do together with everyone, and emphasizes what need to care when doing tasks analysis
                - This type of demo activities will bring people to situation, and have their own learning in different aspects of activities.
                    - Main lesson for tasks analysis
                        - Simple task in head because we did it doesn't mean it simple to describe details for another person who know nothing about it
                        - If the goal and the target participant is not clear, tasks analysis will be very complicated
        - [Opening activities](<Opening activities.md>)
            - Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM6B0k3E25I&ab_channel=ConnectionCoach
                - Benefits of video:
                    - Stimulate the emotions of participants, so it helps to lead to lessons
                    - Put participants into a specific situation, so it helps to lead to the situation that facilitator want students focus on.
                    - Deliver information by stories which help students to remember easier
                    - These benefits are not apply for "how-to" video, but for situation video.
                - "Share 2 outstanding emotions of two children"
                    - With activities have emotion involve, harvest emotions immediately will help students learn.
                        - For examples, an activity that require participants to choose 2 emotions from a list of emotions.
                - "What dad want to teach the children?"
                    - After havest emotions, this is a step to harvest the lesson in that situation of the video.
                    - If ask this question immediately after watch Video, participants can feel confuse, because their mind still focus on the video and the emotions emerge.
                - "How to apply the lesson to design a workshop?"
                    - After harvest lesson based on the situation of the activity, this step is about link to real life situation.
                - The step to harvest an emotional activities
                    - Do activities
                    - Harvest emotions
                    - Harvest lessons in the situation of the activities
                    - Expanded learning to real life situation
        - Fill into space to define "Tasks analysis" process
            - This step to define definition will help people start to think about it as "know" level
            - 
        - 7- Điền vào chỗ trống để định nghĩa quá trình "phân tích nhiệm vụ"

Trước khi yêu cầu mọi người phân tích sâu hơn về quá trình này, thì bước định nghĩa này giúp mọi người bắt đầu tư duy về nó, ở tầng "biết" nó là gì. Buổi sắp tới, tụi mình sẽ cùng mọi người đi qua các bậc tư duy này, và mọi người sẽ hiểu tại sao chúng ta phải dẫn dắt người học qua từng bậc tư duy một cách từ từ, thay vì nhảy ngay lập tức lên bậc cao.
        - What should/ shouldn't do when doing tasks analysis
            - Harvest activities for "boil egg" activities
            - Help people grab the tasks analysis process and its principle
            - It requires people to analyze and evaluate what they just gone through.
        - 8- Những điều nên làm / không nên làm trong quá trình phân tích nhiệm vụ (task analysis) là gì?

Đây là thu hoạch cho hoạt động demo "Luộc trứng" nói trên. Mục đích của hoạt động demo là để cho mọi người nắm được quá trình phân tích nhiệm vụ và các nguyên lý của nó. Phần này để thu hoạch cho phần "nguyên lý", nó yêu cầu mọi người phân tích và đánh giá những gì mình vừa trải qua.
        - Project-based learning 
            - People will execute a small project for them
            - The project in this case is a goal of workshop of 3 students
            - Facilitators also need to attend to the process
                - This is called "scaffolding" - helping process.
                    - Facilitator will support direct by involve and ask questions (high support level). 
                    - Then reduce over time and only involve when necessary. 
                    - At the end, the support will reduce to lowest so that students can complete by themselves.
        - 9- Bốn (04) bước để phân tích nhiệm vụ (task analysis) là gì?

Đây là thu hoạch cho "quá trình phân tích nhiệm vụ". Dạng hoạt động này đã được thực hiện trong các buổi học trước rồi.
        - Harvest after practices
            - This is important after demo, practice, or an activities that have "aha moments".
        - Summarize by "Square, Circle, Triangle" activities
            - Square - what you knew and are reinforced
            - Circle - What you still not clear (fast survey)
            - Triangle - Top 3 important lessons that you have for yourself
- Session 5 - Selecting contents to deliver - Establish basic structure of the workshop
    - [Bloom's taxonomy](<Bloom's taxonomy.md>)
        - New bloom's - remove synthesis, add creating as last level
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FNgoctien%2FFIKUy2-ffy.png?alt=media&token=c4d08854-f103-4fb8-8b53-f415bb8321d4)
        - Design objectives (thiết kế nội dung) are listing knowledge or information that participant need to be able to complete the tasks.
            - Results are list of knowledge or information that need to teach.
        - Đánh giá 
            - tự phân tích đưa ra được đặc điểm của bản thân
            - kiểm chứng đặc điểm của người khác
        - Task là hoạt động cần làm. Objective là hiểu biết nội tại cần thiết để làm được hoạt động.
            - Task là outcome cần, objective là kiến thức để làm được outcome.
            - Task trước, outcome sau.
            - Reality đi trước, không phải personal needs
        - [Krathwohl’s Affective Taxonomy](<Krathwohl’s Affective Taxonomy.md>)
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FNgoctien%2FkZTItUDPQy.png?alt=media&token=4f6754d1-d64d-4e93-9ff6-04c2d7360937)
    - Những điều người học cần biết để làm được điều này là gì?
    - Kiến thức này sẽ giúp họ làm được điều gì?
    - Tasks analysis is listing all of steps a person need to do to complete big goal in real life situation, not classrom situation.
    - Objective analysis is look at classrom situation, and analyze what a person will go through and resolve in the class to complete tasks.
    - The objective of session 5 is let participants design the contents for workshop.
        - Using poll to look back where we are - 
            - This kind of fast question is Interactive Lecture activities. It helps people focus on content and keyword, and increase their thinking level from "know" to "understand" or "analyze.
        - Learning about Bloom's taxonomy
            - Card Sort -> know
            - Example on "boil egg" activities as illustration for each level. -> from know to understand
            - Demo "luộc khoai" -> bring Bloom to a specific context -> easier to understand and apply
            -  Test "understand" level before going to "apply"
                - Definition testing
                    - Objectives design is a process to identify the information a person need to know to be able to complete the tasks.
                    - The results of objectives design is the knowledge that need to teach on the program.
            - "Boil egg" group activities 
                - "Apply" what "understand" in the pre-given context to similar context.
        - The difference between "tasks" and "objective" - analyze level
        - What "should" and "shouldn't on objective design - evaluate level. Creating level will be for personal exercises.
        - Using message "keep kitchen clean" to lead to another knowledge [Krathwohl’s Affective Taxonomy](<Krathwohl’s Affective Taxonomy.md>).
            - Write down all of ways to deliver the above message. 
        - Another card sort to **know **about [Krathwohl’s Affective Taxonomy](<Krathwohl’s Affective Taxonomy.md>)
            - Example from "boil egg" to **understand**
            - What are expressions coressponding to Affective level about "Workshop online still have effective interaction"? - hidden agenda - Let prople bring up by themselves
        - Summarize: choose and complete 3 sentences regard to 3 stage of Bloom
        - The sequences of activites are to help people level up their level of thinking, if they are already level up before the activities happen, then that activities are not needed anymore.
- Session 6
    - Cấu trúc của một buổi học
        - Mở đầu
            - Tạo không gian cho chương trình diễn ra hiệu quả
        - Phần chính
            - Cho người học thể hiện những gì đã biết
                - Lấp đầy
        - Thu hoạch
            - Đan xen phần chính và thu hoạch
- Session 7
    - Textra là dạng hoạt động yêu cầu người học cùng nhau xử lý một tài liệu chữ, theo hướng dẫn của người điều phối. [Textra game](<Textra game.md>)
        - Textra có thể sử dụng với nội dung "chuẩn", ví dụ như kiến thức từ chuyên gia, quy trình từ tổ chức... được viết thành tài liệu chuẩn mực. Các tài liệu có thể đã được chọn lọc (ví dụ như tài liệu tụi mình gửi cho mọi người) hoặc chưa được chọn lọc (ví dụ: sách, bài viết tạp chí, website...). Các yêu cầu cho người học xử lý thường là tìm ra, đúc kết một điểm nào đó trong một tổng thể lớn thay vì xử lý toàn bộ tổng thể, rồi cùng chia sẻ với những người khác để tìm hiểu các phần khác nhau của tổng thể. Hiệu quả của hoạt động phụ thuộc vào tài liệu có được đóng khung cẩn thận hay không, và yêu cầu có rõ ràng hay không.
    - Structured Sharing là dạng hoạt động yêu cầu người học thảo luận theo nhóm, với cấu trúc thảo luận và đúc kết cho trước. [Structured sharing activity](<Structured sharing activity.md>)
        - Structured Sharing có thể sử dụng với nội dung mang tính quan điểm, ý kiến, kinh nghiệm cá nhân của người tham gia. Trong đó, các thông tin được chia sẻ theo một cấu trúc được dẫn dắt bởi câu hỏi hoặc đề mục lớn, mà người tham gia sẽ trả lời hoặc hoàn thành cùng nhau. Hiệu quả của hoạt động phụ thuộc vào các câu hỏi hoặc đề mục đưa ra, các câu hỏi cần rõ ràng, đơn giản, tập trung, tránh người tham gia hiểu theo nhiều nghĩa khác nhau.
    - 5- Sắp xếp các hoạt động đã từng thực hiện trong chương trình vào bảng [Item processing activities](<Item processing activities.md>)

Đây là hoạt động dạng "Items Processing", trong đó người học sẽ cùng nhau xử lý những thông tin nhỏ, ngắn, theo trình tự. Trong hoạt động này, thông tin đưa ra là "các hoạt động mà mọi người trải nghiệm từ đầu tới giờ", và thông tin nữa là "các dạng hoạt động" gồm 7 dạng. Mọi người được yêu cầu xử lý và sắp xếp các hoạt động vào các dạng.

Trên đây là thông tin do người điều phối đưa ra, và mọi người chỉ xử lý và sắp xếp.

Nếu có thêm thời gian, tụi mình còn có thể yêu cầu mọi người tự viết ra các hoạt động mà mọi người còn nhớ từ đầu tới giờ, rồi mới sắp xếp. Lúc này, thông tin lại là do mọi người đưa ra. Như vậy, hoạt động dạng "Items Processing" có thể được thực hiện trên thông tin do người điều phối hoặc người học đưa ra.

Items Processing yêu cầu người tham gia xử lý các thông tin ngắn đó theo một trình tự nào đó, để ra được một kết quả. Trình tự đó sẽ được dẫn dắt từng bước để dần đạt được kết quả đó. Hiệu quả của hoạt động phụ thuộc vào việc thông tin có được đưa ra rõ ràng hay không, và trình tự có phù hợp, dễ thực hiện hay không.

Một ví dụ khác của "Items Processing" chính là hoạt động "Card Sort" mà mọi người trải qua mấy lần, ví dụ như: sắp xếp các cấp độ tư duy Bloom theo đúng trình tự, sau đó sắp xếp các mô tả cho đúng cấp độ, và sau đó viết ra các ví dụ cho từng cấp độ.
    - Phần lớn Framegame thường được sử dụng khi nội dung mang tính tư duy, kiến thức, ít yếu tố cảm xúc. Các framegame khác nhau có thể đưa người tham gia lên các tầng tư duy khác nhau. Ví dụ: Textra hoặc Items Processing có thể đưa người tham gia lên tầng biết, hiểu. Nếu có kèm thực hành thì có thể đưa lên tầng ứng dụng. Sau đó Structured Sharing có thể đưa người tham gia lên tầng phân tích, đánh giá. Framegame phù hợp với tất cả các dạng thông tin (Facts, Concepts, Principles, Procedures), miễn là người học được đưa lên một tầng tư duy nào đó. [Framegame](<Framegame.md>)
    - Practical activity là các hoạt động mang tính thực hành, phù hợp nhất với những quy trình, nguyên tắc (Procedures, Principles). Trong đó, người tham gia nên được xem demo trước, xử lý demo đó, và làm theo. Phần xử lý demo có thể ứng dụng framegame để thực hiện. [Practical activity](<Practical activity.md>)
    - Insightful activity là các hoạt động có bài học cụ thể, theo chủ đề, ví dụ: bài học về lắng nghe, lãnh đạo, cảm xúc... Và một hoạt động thường chỉ giúp bộc lộ ra một vài bài học. Nếu muốn có bài học khác thì phải sử dụng hoạt động khác. Các bài học này thường được lộ ra khi người học có cảm xúc. Như vậy, đặc thù của hoạt động Insightful activity là "trải nghiệm có cảm xúc". Và sau mỗi hoạt động này, người điều phối luôn cần thu hoạch cho hoạt động để người tham gia đúc kết được bài học. Hoạt động Insightful activity phù hợp nhất với dạng thông tin Concepts (khái niệm) và Principles (nguyên tắc), vì các dạng thông tin này cần trải nghiệm mới có thể hiểu sâu hơn được. Ví dụ: một chương trình đào tạo về EQ mà chỉ có thảo luận, phân tích, chia sẻ bằng các framegame thì có thể không hiệu quả, vì EQ là một khái niệm cần trải nghiệm. Như vậy, người thiết kế cần sử dụng hoạt động nào đó cho mọi người trải nghiệm có cảm xúc cho nội dung EQ này. [Insightful activity](<Insightful activity.md>)
    - Debriefing là các hoạt động giúp thu hoạch bài học từ các hoạt động còn lại. Và quá trình thu hoạch nên được dẫn dắt từ từ, qua từng giai đoạn, thì người học mới có thể đúc kết được bài học sâu sắc. [Debriefing activity](<Debriefing activity.md>)
    - 11- Stop - Start - Continue [Closer activity](<Closer activity.md>)
- Session 8
    - 4- Xếp hình [Insightful activity](<Insightful activity.md>)

Yêu cầu rất đơn giản, mọi người cùng nhau xếp một tấm hình Jigsaw.

Hoạt động này là dạng "Graphic Game", trong đó mọi người được xử lý hình ảnh. Có 2 cách xử lý hình ảnh này: một là quá trình xếp hình, hai là ý nghĩa của hình ảnh sau khi xếp được.

Hoạt động này cũng được xếp vào nhóm "Insightful Activity" vì sau hoạt động, người học có thể đúc kết ra những bài học cụ thể từ quá trình trải nghiệm, liên quan tới chủ đề.

Để đúc kết bài học liên quan tới một "quá trình, quy trình" nào đó, mọi người có thể sử dụng một quy trình tương tự nhưng đơn giản hơn nhiều để làm "ẩn dụ", từ đó có thể đúc kết ra bài học cho quy trình đơn giản này, và liên tưởng tới quy trình mà mình muốn đào sâu.

    - 8- Thu hoạch cảm xúc trong buổi thực hành [Harvest emotion activity](<Harvest emotion activity.md>)

Việc thu hoạch cảm xúc sẽ giúp tháo gỡ và làm rõ những băn khoăn, khúc mắc vẫn còn tồn đọng trong buổi học. Có nhiều cách để thực hiện phần thu hoạch cảm xúc. Riêng phần này, tụi mình chọn "thang đo cảm xúc" vì muốn nhìn thấy sự khác biệt giữa cảm xúc của mọi người. Từ sự khác biệt này, những trải nghiệm đặc biệt sẽ dễ dàng được lộ ra (ví dụ như một người có một cảm xúc nào đó mà toàn bộ những người khác đều không có hoặc ngược lại).
    - 9- Chia sẻ về quá khứ, hiện tại, tương lai [Debriefing activity](<Debriefing activity.md>)

Đây là một hoạt động dạng "Graphic Game" và cũng là "Debriefing". Mọi người có thể thấy là một cách thực hiện (dùng hình ảnh) có thể được sử dụng cho nhiều phần khác nhau (mở đầu, truyền tải nội dung, thu hoạch, tổng kết).

Nếu thực hiện trực tiếp, mọi người còn có thể cho người học giữ lại tấm hình để ghi nhớ bài học và ghi nhớ chương trình, như một món quà.
    - 10- Viết một lời nhắn nhủ cho học viên khóa sau để họ có thể chuẩn bị cho khóa học tốt hơn

Thực chất tụi mình muốn mọi người tự viết ra lời nhắn nhủ cho riêng mình, nhưng nếu đưa ra yêu cầu đó thì suy nghĩ của mọi người sẽ không còn khách quan nữa.

Vì vậy, tụi mình yêu cầu mọi người viết ra lời nhắn nhủ cho học viên khóa sau, và chính những lời nhắn nhủ này cũng là điều mọi người có thể ứng dụng cho bản thân mình.
- Session 9 
    - [4F Debrief Framework](<4F Debrief Framework.md>)
        - Facts - Establish the context
            - Share observations
        - Feelings are the bridge between facts and findings/lessons
            - Adjust state of feelings
        - Findings - Find the gap between the experiences and what expected - and how to fill in the gap that's not fill yet
            - Limit in the activites and not expand yet
            - Fill in the gaps - If do again, what you want to do different?
            - Change word "lesson" into "specific context"
        - Future - expanded learning (expand new context, change context) - learning transfer 
            - Similar contexts in real life?
            - New context/ What if?
            - What's next?
    - 4- Thu hoạch cảm xúc (Feelings) [Harvest emotion activity](<Harvest emotion activity.md>)

Đây là một "Graphic Game" sử dụng cho thu hoạch. Thay vì gửi sẵn hình ảnh, tụi mình yêu cầu mọi người chọn trong một thư viện lớn hơn. Nếu muốn linh hoạt nữa thì người tham gia còn có thể được yêu cầu để chọn trong thư viện online ở các nguồn

https://www.canva.com/https://unsplash.com/https://pixabay.com/https://www.pinterest.com/

Nếu mình linh hoạt về nguồn thông tin thì mọi người có thể thấy rằng, trong rất nhiều trường hợp người điều phối không cần chuẩn bị trước thông tin, mà có thể yêu cầu người tham gia chuẩn bị ngay trong lớp học. Tất nhiên, việc này sẽ khó thực hiện từ đầu chương trình vì mọi người chưa quen nhau, và chỉ nên thực hiện và giữa hoặc cuối chương trình.
    - 5- Thu hoạch sự kiện (Facts) [Harvest facts activity](<Harvest facts activity.md>)

Dùng các hình ảnh trên để chia sẻ về cảm xúc, từ đó phần "Facts" có thể được thu hoạch bằng cách trả lời câu hỏi sau:

- Cảm xúc của người kia là gì?
- Điều gì khiến họ có cảm xúc đó?

Trong quá trình chia sẻ lại cho cả nhóm biết, mình phỏng vấn tất cả mọi người. Và đây là lúc nghệ thuật "dẫn dắt câu chuyện" của người điều phối được vận dụng. Người điều phối sẽ cần thảo luận, lắng nghe, và làm sao để nổi bật lên một vài bài học chủ đạo trong chia sẻ của mọi người.

Nếu người điều phối muốn làm nổi bật bài học gì thì ngay từ phần phỏng vấn này, người điều phối cần ghi lại một vài từ khóa hướng tới bài học đó.

Ví dụ trong phần phỏng vấn, mình đã ghi lại các từ khóa sau vào Jamboard:
- Lo chạy theo câu hỏi của người khác
- Nên có ý kiến để thảo luận với nhau
- Mỗi câu hỏi sẽ giúp mình sáng hơn
- Teamwork, cần có tính liên kết
- Sự hiểu giữa hai người khác nhau
- Cầm chìa khóa mà không nhận ra
- Làm rõ luật chơi

Toàn bộ các từ này đều có thể dẫn tới bài học về sự thống nhất, hợp tác.
    - 6- Findings trong ngữ cảnh của hoạt động: Nếu được làm lại, bạn sẽ thực hiện hoạt động này khác đi như thế nào? [Harvest findings activity](<Harvest findings activity.md>)

Finding (bài học) là quá trình đúc kết ra những cách, lưu ý, nhận định để lấp đầy khoảng cách giữa trạng thái hiện tại và trạng thái hoàn hảo.

Nhờ quá trình phỏng vấn và ghi lại từ khóa, phần này mọi người tổng hợp lại những cách để "lấp đầy khoảng trống" trong ngữ cảnh của hoạt động vừa trải qua.

Nếu không có bước này thì sẽ rất khó để đúc kết bài học trong thực tế. Bước đúc kết bài học trong ngữ cảnh của hoạt động sẽ giúp "bắc cầu" từ hoạt động tới thực tế.
        - 7- Findings trong ngữ cảnh thực tế, rộng hơn một chút: Làm cách nào để đặt câu hỏi nhằm khai thác thông tin từ người khác hiệu quả?

Nếu định hướng cuối cùng của bài học là "sự hợp tác giữa ID, SME, Trainer", đây là bước đệm từ hoạt động về câu hỏi tới sự hợp tác này.

8- Findings (What If?) mở rộng tiếp ngữ cảnh, bằng cách nghĩ ra các biến thể để giúp mở rộng tình huống. 

Các biến thể như vậy có thể giúp người tham gia nghĩ tới các tình huống khác. Nếu còn thêm thời gian, người điều phối có thể hỏi câu hỏi "Có những tình huống nào trong thực tế tương tự như tình huống này?" và liên tưởng bài học tới tình huống thực tế đó.

    - 
9- Future: Bạn có thể áp dụng những bài học vừa rồi vào quá trình thiết kế chương trình như thế nào? [Future application](<Future application.md>)

Cuối cùng thì đích đến là "thiết kế chương trình". Sau khi mở rộng ra nhiều bài học ở nhiều tình huống mới, lúc này mọi người được tập trung vào một tình huống cụ thể.
        - 10- Future: Hoạt động mở rộng lời khuyên.

Tụi mình lấy các bài học trong phần 9, dùng thuật toán ngẫu nhiên và yêu cầu mọi người mở rộng bài học đó thêm một lần nữa. Cách này sẽ giúp bài học càng mở rộng hơn nữa, và định hướng được hành động cuối cùng.

Có rất nhiều cách để mở rộng lời khuyên theo cách này. Phần mở rộng có thể là:
- Ứng dụng trong tình huống cụ thể
- Mở rộng lời khuyên bằng các hướng suy nghĩ mới, ví dụ "Lời khuyên này không phù hợp với...", "Lời khuyên này có thể thành vấn đề nếu...", "Lời khuyên này không hiệu quả nếu thiếu...", "Lời khuyên này phù hợp nhất với đối tượng..."

Nếu thực hiện trong lớp trực tiếp, bạn có thể dùng xí ngầu (xúc xắc) và giới hạn ở 6 lời khuyên và 6 lời mở rộng.
- Session 10
    - Viết rubric trong giai đoạn phân tích nhiệm vụ
        - Đánh giá cái gì thì dạy dựa trên cái đó (Teaching based on expected outcome)
    - 3- Trò chơi "Dodgeball Review" [Review activity](<Review activity.md>)

Những hoạt động reviewing (nhìn lại toàn bộ nội dung chương trình) nên được thực hiện thành trò chơi, bởi vì trò chơi sẽ giúp đưa yếu tố vui vẻ, hào hứng vào quá trình thường nhàm chán này.

Trò chơi này có các bước như sau:
- Hai đội viết ra các câu hỏi cùng câu trả lời nhằm kiểm tra mức độ nắm rõ nội dung đào tạo của đội kia. Viết được càng nhiều câu hỏi càng tốt.
- Mỗi thành viên của đội này khi đến lượt của mình thì chọn một người của đội kia để hỏi. Ví dụ : A1 hỏi B1.
- Nếu B1 trả lời đúng, thì A1 bị loại, và B1 dành quyền hỏi tiếp theo.
- Nếu B1 trả lời sai, thì B1 bị loại, và A1 dành quyền hỏi tiếp theo.
- (Đây là luật bổ sung) Nếu trong một vòng chơi của một người, người đó loại được một thành viên của đội kia thì có thể hồi sinh một người của đội mình.
- Trò chơi kết thúc khi (1) hết giờ, hoặc (2) một đội không còn thành viên nào sống sót, hoặc (3) một đội hết câu hỏi để hỏi. Lúc đó, đội nào còn nhiều thành viên hơn thì thắng cuộc.

Mọi người có thể kéo dài và thực hiện phần "chuẩn bị câu hỏi" một cách cẩn thận hơn, để đảm bảo thành viên trong nhóm thực sự nhìn lại nội dung và chuẩn bị câu hỏi.
    - 4- Hai dạng đánh giá kết quả [Ways to evaluate](<Ways to evaluate.md>)

Dạng đánh giá kết quả tập trung vào nắm bắt kiến thức, nội dung (knowledge) và dạng đánh giá kết quả tập trung vào sản phẩm, hành động, nhiệm vụ làm được (performance). Và mỗi cấp độ của Bloom cũng tương ứng với một hoặc cả hai dạng đánh giá kết quả này.
        - 5- Thảo luận về cách đánh giá theo các cấp độ của Bloom

Đây là hoạt động dạng Structured Sharing, kết quả là các cách thức, công cụ để mọi người có thể sử dụng trong quá trình đánh giá kết quả của người tham gia.
        - 6- Demo quá trình viết rubric và thực hành [Practical activity](<Practical activity.md>)

Đây là hoạt động dạng Practical Activity. Viết Rubric là một bước quan trọng, cần thiết để biết được chất lượng cuối cùng mà mình muốn người học đạt được là mức độ nào, từ đó thiết kế chương trình để hướng tới chất lượng đó.

Vì vậy Rubric nên được viết ra sớm, để chương trình có thể tập trung vào để "chỉ truyền tải những gì được dùng trong bảng đánh giá" (MUST-KNOW) thay vì đưa vào cả những nội dung liên quan nhưng không cần thiết vào lúc này (GOOD-TO-KNOW).
