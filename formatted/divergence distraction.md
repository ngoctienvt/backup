- Ideally, I want to have work to focus on and make the learning experience feel so naturally without the divergence of inner state, but convergence instead. [convergence focus](<convergence focus.md>) versus [divergence distraction](<divergence distraction.md>)

- [convergence focus](<convergence focus.md>) will about I have a thing with [clear intention](<clear intention.md>), [constraint](<constraint.md>) and [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) to focus on in a certain period of times with assurance feeling about [divergence distraction](<divergence distraction.md>)
