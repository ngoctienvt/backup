## [October 3rd, 2020](<October 3rd, 2020.md>)
- I felt kind of [uncomfortable](<uncomfortable.md>) when clients canceled the coaching session when the time was near. It makes me feel [disturbed](<disturbed.md>) because it likes I need to change my direction suddenly when I already have the feel of flow that I plan ahead. I realize that I still have an [attachment](<attachment.md>) with the near future instead of fully focus on now and hold myself unattached to anything.

- I felt that I still tended to defend and protect myself. I am still easy to get trigger by other people and didn't come in with reality with a neutral attitude yet. I want to learn to be able to [unattachment](<unattachment.md>)

## [September 20th, 2020](<September 20th, 2020.md>)
- I feel that I still have too many [personal needs](<personal needs.md>) to control others based on the attachment with my ideas of what's right or wrong when I interacted with Hương and Thảo. I iI want to release all the unattachment even with the things that I feel are right and better. Even if it's true, the importance is not the truth, but to support others in a [helpful manner](<helpful manner.md>) to live the truth. Because the truth is standing for itself, there is no need to defense for it, it's just my [personal needs](<personal needs.md>) [unattachment](<unattachment.md>)

- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) I felt pretty surprised but not too much when Linh asked me for help. I knew that she seems strong outside, but she also has a strong identification with the physical world. And now, they are gone, so she is under a big lesson for her spiritual growth. I realized that I always want to support her, though some thoughts about the romantic relationship still pop-up in my head. I want to release all those possessive thoughts and support her with the cleanest heart and mind as possible. [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>) [unattachment](<unattachment.md>)

- I still have a conflict between accepting as it is versus want them to be better. The [personal agenda](<personal agenda.md>) for wanting people to be better makes me can't accepting as it is FIRST. I want to set myself to a state that can accept everything as it is without any [personal needs](<personal needs.md>) and [personal agenda](<personal agenda.md>) FIRST. Then, if I still want to support them to be better, this support will be completely [unattachment](<unattachment.md>).
