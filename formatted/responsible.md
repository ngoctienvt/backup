## [September 23rd, 2020](<September 23rd, 2020.md>)
- I realized I used to base my love on the lack of inner love, the [personal needs](<personal needs.md>). I want to change this to an attitude that I completely responsible for my [personal needs](<personal needs.md>) and [inner love](<inner love.md>). If I have a relationship with someone, I also responsible for giving that person the best support and love that I could share with her. I'm [responsible](<responsible.md>)
