- I feel so fear when my graph becomes a mess and loss a lot of data. I realized the truth that if what I have is already inside of me, and the external is just support me, then I still can rebuild my own stuff and even make them become better. The whole point is inside-out. [fear of loss aversion](<fear of loss aversion.md>)
