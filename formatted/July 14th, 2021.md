- I noticed that I have a strong attachment and insecurity for the house. I feel fear and have the tendency to worry about what might happen, while it's not happening yet. It will need to be work to release out of the attachments and be ready for whatever life present me into with a better attitude.
- I'm also feel quite restless about the course that I want to do. I worry that there will be nobody join, and it will be ignore. The ego and the attachments about the me still so strong that need to work on.
