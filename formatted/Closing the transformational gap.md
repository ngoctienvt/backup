- [coaching process](<coaching process.md>)
- [end goals](<end goals.md>) is the final goal that we want to achieve,
- [intermediary goals](<intermediary goals.md>) are the goals that we need to work with so that it could help us to close [the transformational gap](<the transformational gap.md>), so we can closer to our [end goals](<end goals.md>)
- [means](<means.md>) are the [method](<method.md>) that helped us to come closer to our goals
- For example: what we aim to will be the [end goals](<end goals.md>), but [the transformational gap](<the transformational gap.md>) is too big that we need to find some [intermediary goals](<intermediary goals.md>) so we can move forward and upgrade ourselves in the process. [means](<means.md>) are the methods, practices, supports that helped us in the moving forward process.
- Note: 
    - Most clients can only see their [intermediary goals](<intermediary goals.md>) and focus too much to the [means](<means.md>) to achieve it, that most of time makes them get stuck in the process. 
    - The reason is most clients perceived [intermediary goals](<intermediary goals.md>) as [end goals](<end goals.md>), they thought they will get what they really want by achieving it but it's not what usually happens. Most of the time, until and unless their [hidden concern](<hidden concern.md>) or what's they truly want to reveal and they can see the [end goals](<end goals.md>) that they really want, most of [coaching](<coaching.md>) still work on the surface level. 
    - [trust](<trust.md>) and [connection](<connection.md>) are the necessary conditions to establish a healthy coaching relationship that can go deep. Coaches will need to realize that focus too much on the coaching result, they will easy to neglect these conditions. 
    - [end goals](<end goals.md>) of coaches for coaching should be the [natural way of living life](<natural way of living life.md>) development of clients as a whole through series of free choice, instead of forcing to have short-term results.

- When reading [Surat Shabd Yoga](<Surat Shabd Yoga.md>), it's very helpful for me to realize that the furthest what I learned can bring me is to release other things that I believe in, but then the last thing I need to do as well is release even what brought me to there. Just like the raft can help me navigate all the ways through seas, rivers, challenges, but in the end, I need to let go of it so I can reach the final destination.
