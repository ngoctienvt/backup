- [Daily Worthy Stories](<Daily Worthy Stories.md>) Yesterday and today, I noticed that I feel hard for presence and simply listen what being shared to me. I felt that I can’t center and let things happen but trying to protect myself for being influence. 
- I felt so much annoy and disturb when hear criticize and complaint about me, though it’s very unlogical and not constructive. I felt so much angry and uncomfortable. It’s easy to ignore if it’s not repeat, but I’m so much frustrated about things that I feel it will repeat and I don’t know how to handle that situation. I felt that I’m always carry my burden alone and other people don’t understand me, or even try to understand me. I also feel very uncomfortable when I know that’s my existence could disturbe other people wellbeing, but it’s not possible for me to handle other people all of their inner samskaras, they will also need to take responsibility and handle for themselves.
