- I slowly completed my picture. I already somehow developed my [journey of wisdom](<journey of wisdom.md>). It is the process that I will digest external knowledge and self-realization to transform them to my wisdom and share it to the world.
- Now today I will work on what will be my process to achieve my [personal end goals](<personal end goals.md>) by closing the gap progressively and not feel stuck.
    - The [bottom-up approach](<bottom-up approach.md>) is about how I could create [optimal conditions](<optimal conditions.md>) and [design for emergence](<design for emergence.md>) of wisdom. 
    - While [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>) will start mainly with my [personal end goals](<personal end goals.md>), then break it down to become the things that I just need to clarify and to work on by the support of [bottom-up approach](<bottom-up approach.md>).
