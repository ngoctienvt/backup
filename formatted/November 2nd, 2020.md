- I felt that I'm extremely hard to want people to live the higher truth, but I'm lacking the [helpful manner](<helpful manner.md>) to establish connection and understanding first. 
    - It's like I know what's important for the child, but it's not suitable to give them advice when they are drowning.
- Today I will continue to focus on learn Effortless Output with Roam.
- I noticed that I still have the tendency to look for solutions before truly knowing what I want to do. [point of focus](<point of focus.md>) [seeking clarity before resolving](<seeking clarity before resolving.md>)
- I noticed that I also have tendency to look things at big picture and have a definitive solution instead of working step by step. [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>)[coaching goals](<coaching goals.md>) [the relationship between end goals and methods](<the relationship between end goals and methods.md>)
    - Choose the [end goal](<end goal.md>) wisely
        - For instance, make becoming a good [spiritual practitioner](<spiritual practitioner.md>) at end goals. [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>)
            - Other things are methods, tests, feedbacks for that goal
            - Like becoming a lover, a parent, a friend, a son... as a [road of trials](<road of trials.md>) for you to become a greater being
            - They are the [by-product](<by-product.md>) when you become a [greater being](<greater being.md>). And as long as I focus myself to this end goals. I will eventually become better and will never be lost or wrong again, only better over time.
        - Instead of making become a good lover as a end goals
            - Because we will easy to use devil methods to reach the wrong things.
- It sounds like [Course - Effortless Output with Roam](<Course - Effortless Output with Roam.md>) is very good to utilize external resources, while I will need to learn how to include my own insight and my own daily [inbox](<inbox.md>), as well as way to organize these tags to consolidate to a different kind of understanding based on my keywords.
- I can feel so clearly that I'm starting more and more walking on my own personal path.
- [reading workflow](<reading workflow.md>) 
    - First, capturing the salient parts of what you read using highlights. 
    - Second, periodically reviewing those highlights, which is typically where most people falter and is also what the Readwise email makes easy.
    -  And third, integrating what you've read into your life.
    - [natural progression](<natural progression.md>)
        - Step 1: Capturing Reactions - write my thoughts or emotions related to what I read - write between the lines
        - Step 2: Active Review
        - Step 3: Integrate - [compressed understanding](<compressed understanding.md>) or [evergreen insight](<evergreen insight.md>)
        - Step 4: Resurface [compressed understanding](<compressed understanding.md>)
- **[New awareness](<New awareness.md>):** I noticed that I'm learning to keep myself away from grab or involve with my thoughts, emotions and my samskaras. 

I'm on the process to learn to lean myself away from my inner stuff and my inner voice. I let them do what they needed even though without my involvement. [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>)
- I also learn to create my own [personal knowledge development](<personal knowledge development.md>) system in a way that it fully makes sense to me.
- I felt that I start to have a [workflow](<workflow.md>) that truly works for me. 
    - Somehow it will be something like this.
        - [Free-thoughts](<Free-thoughts.md>) - whatever my thoughts about certain things (questions, emerging thoughts, new ideas...). 
            - How to direct my free-thoughts in a helpful way
                - Clarity what I really want, instead of focus on the method and what's possible first
                - Focus on contextual usages to find true helpful answers
        - Key summary, new awareness, expanded answers - the condensed summarization for the above free-thoughts
        - What's left is what I still need to grow next, or haven't fully clear yet? - [Expanding questions](<Expanding questions.md>)
    - The workflow will develop base on my [natural progression](<natural progression.md>) of development and what I'm truly want, then I will develop new way of thinking, learning new things so that it will support the above desire.
        - One of new [way of thinking](<way of thinking.md>) I feel that I will need to develop now is [think in a filter way](<think in a filter way.md>) instead of the normal searching, or finding way. Think in a filter way is about finding things based on it [contextual usages](<contextual usages.md>).
        - Other is have a [workplace](<workplace.md>) for what I want to work with like [Expanding questions](<Expanding questions.md>) or where to inbox free thoughts. And then how to put the answers back to their place.
