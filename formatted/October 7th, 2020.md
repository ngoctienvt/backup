- Last night I had two [dream](<dream.md>)
    - One is about my families, we had misunderstanding, conflicts, and have a hard time to open our heart to each other. I also notice that I haven't able to contain all of my parents pain, expectations, their effort to complement for their inner disturbances. [families](<families.md>)
    - Two is about school and become tough to deal with other people. I felt that I'm raising myself over all of the notion about how things should be, all of the moral ethics, and the structure that try to control us. [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>) [soul evolution](<soul evolution.md>) [transcendence](<transcendence.md>)
- In this morning, I didn't hear the alarm so I woke up later, but I realized that I still think about what I need to do next. And my tendency is to drown back to the sea of thoughts and dreams. Instead of raising myself and disconnect with it to do my [morning rituals](<morning rituals.md>) [transcendence](<transcendence.md>).
- My today focus would be about:
    - [x] preparing a little bit sharing about [freedom](<freedom.md>) and [wisdom](<wisdom.md>) on Saturday [sharing about true happiness](<sharing about true happiness.md>) [true happiness](<true happiness.md>)
    - [x] continuing reading [Book - How to take smart notes](<Book - How to take smart notes.md>)
    - [ ] merging the [living from the place of surrender](<living from the place of surrender.md>) with the concept of [natural progression](<natural progression.md>)
- I fall asleep after this [morning rituals](<morning rituals.md>), I am not able to keep myself awake and get used to the wake up stage. I want to work on this more to keep my consciousness awake on a longer period of times. It would relate to [energy management](<energy management.md>) and nurture my consciousness [willpower](<willpower.md>) to remain the ability to conscious more. This would be more about [spiritual energy](<spiritual energy.md>) and a part of [physical energy](<physical energy.md>). [nurturing the wake up state of consciousness](<nurturing the wake up state of consciousness.md>)
- I still have an attachment for my Ode to Heroes account that I don't want it to be below what it could be and react with other people behaviors to bring it below my standard. [personal standards](<personal standards.md>) versus [impersonal standards](<impersonal standards.md>)

[living from the place of surrender](<living from the place of surrender.md>) is about shifting from living the personal parts to transform them to impersonal parts, from controlling and clinging to flowing and raising, from attachment to unattachment.
- [journaling training](<journaling training.md>) The whole point is not what we do or what tool we use, but understanding the process so that we could build ourselves based on that. 

If we identified with our thoughts and believed this is normal, there is no thing to say. But if we realized that we could go higher and not trap on our thoughts, then we will create the process to help us raise above our thoughts. [understanding the truth](<understanding the truth.md>) and create the [support system](<support system.md>) to help us live that truth. And more than that, it's about our [desire](<desire.md>) to live that truth.
- I thought that I'm very good at [direct communication](<direct communication.md>), but it's not true. I'm only good at it when it directly related to me and I can't accept it, or when I feel safe enough to tell other person. 
- This afternoon I start to practice [nurturing the wake up state of consciousness](<nurturing the wake up state of consciousness.md>) more by cleaning the inner samskaras continuously. I feel good about this and start to become easier to conscious. And start to release the habit-formed will to asleep into identification and pulled out of [seat of consciousness](<seat of consciousness.md>)

- I felt a little hot inside due to the energy accumulated from playing games, not sure it's from external or internal but all I need to do is releasing them fully so I could prepare myself for an coaching session. Coaching is all about listening, about what I can hear and what I don't hear, and it's all about how can I hear them and understand them objectively. 
- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) Tonight coaching with Háº±ng, I felt that I can focus and sure about the truth that I saw with more confident, though I still have a little bit tough and lack of [compassion](<compassion.md>). 

I want to develop the combination between a [tough love](<tough love.md>) and [compassion](<compassion.md>) in a way that they merge with each other so I can coach with a tough love but let my compassion inspire the way. [helpful manner](<helpful manner.md>)

I also realize that I still have a bit of [top-down](<top-down.md>) expectation instead of helping fully working from [bottom-up approach](<bottom-up approach.md>) and move forward the way.
