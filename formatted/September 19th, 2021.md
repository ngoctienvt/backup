    - Reflection
        - I notice that I become more and more expansive inside. I start to become more and more center, and faster to realize I'm being distracted. The center is moving closer to the self.
        - I start to see that the merging between coaching and spirituality is coming up, and reveal the path of my way of working.
            - I learn to establish the unique expression of myself to serve the world, while still embrace the work of all other masters.
            - I start to think more about how to improve my coaching skill and what would coaching mean for me, so that the path is clearer.
        - I learn to less care about the outside, the form and care more about the intention, the spirit. I learn to release judgement, and learn to include more.
        - When playing game, I learn to become more relax, satisfy with now, enjoy the process, and raise the inner energy, let go the need of not doing wrong, make mistakes, and optimization.
            - It's all about the challenges will help me to fine tune my own abilities, rather than just using the mind fine tune without the help of reality.
        - It's also important for me learn to re-frame the way I see love and romantic relationship, so that the center is me and reality. Rather than specific relationship, because they are just a part of it.
        - I also learn to let go the judgement about other people when they're putting me into difficult situations. It's hard though, because the center is not me yet, and I still feel fear, feel the disturbances inside, and have a way that thing should be, rather than seeing life in a way that more inclusive. 
        - I can feel that my life has shift and change gradually these years, these months without I even notice how much I change inside. The need to care about outside will also need to let go as what's important is all about how much I open inside, how much I center in the seat of the self, and how much purify in the heart, how wise the mind could be. And the intention to harmony with truth, with the dao path, with reality.
