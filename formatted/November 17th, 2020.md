- I felt that my [ðŸŒ²Workflow ](<ðŸŒ²Workflow .md>) for the morning is more about cleaning, recharging, and consuming new knowledge. I will work on the main tasks in the afternoon.
- I noticed that the way I breakdown data is making them out of context, so that I can fully digest it personally, but at the same time, I'm breaking it out of context instead of keeping the context for writing literature note. 

This is helpful for me to learn and develop my personal knowledge, but then I will need to write up fully by myself later. I will think about a way to still maintain certain context while digesting them fully at the same time. [Personal Knowledge Development cycle ðŸŒ² ](<Personal Knowledge Development cycle ðŸŒ² .md>)
- I noticed that I want to let myself satisfy and fulfil by higher purpose like love, [soul evolution](<soul evolution.md>) or [serving the demand of reality](<serving the demand of reality.md>). Instead of lower purpose from lower-self like sexual, owning, controlling, recognition...
- Today focus:
    - Consuming productivity course of [Ali Abdaal](<Ali Abdaal.md>)
    - Continue working on Workflow
- Today I'm starting to work slowly on collect data from external and learn to process them to become my own wisdom. I also start to build my self a new habit pattern that take back my [freewill](<freewill.md>) from my feelings to build up my ideal workflow.
- I suddenly feel that I lost certain information, not sure because of my fault or because of Roam Research. This feeling of loss makes me uncomfortable and unsecured. But it's okay,  as long as it's mine, I could always create them back. If not, then there is no need to fear of losing it.
- I still not sure how I will use my tag properly, it's making me kind of confused about the structure to build my [ðŸŒ²PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System ](<ðŸŒ²PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System .md>) clean and optimal. [Tag usage](<Tag usage.md>) [information structuring](<information structuring.md>)
- Today when hearing about next week I have to come back to Vung Tau to examine my health for national service. I feel really uncomfortable inside my heart, fear, anxiety, worry, resistance,... and this is truly a big [samskaras](<samskaras.md>) that I need to work on. 

I also noticed that I'm not comfortable with my parents about the fact that they are keep expecting me to do what they want. I do not fully resolve this yet. These samskaras will be the main samskaras that I will spend my time to work on this week.

This is a big opportunity for me to learn to handle the societies, my need for convenience, and learn to nurture my ability for [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>), so that I can keep myself detach with the disturbances of my heart and my mind.
- I noticed that when I'm thinking about writing an article, my mind filled with the need to supplement that with other related explanations so that the audience can dig deeper and learn from a single source of truth. It will not be able to build one time, but just like my PKD, I can build them up slowly and this is probably my best wish for creating the blog. [single source of truth](<single source of truth.md>) [personal blog](<personal blog.md>)

And the goal is to build the blog that holds a single source of truth that the audience can easily learn by themselves.
