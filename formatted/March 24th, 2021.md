- I noticed that I want to play the game of life as best as possible, rather than playing it unconscious and creating more mess. 
    - I noticed that I have the tendency to find the best answer, but I neglect the fact that the best answer will not possible for everything. The best answer is about how much I conscious, aware, and have a suitable response based on my current ability. 
        - The result will not depend on me, and full of my control. That's what life will be responsible for.
        - My ultimate answer is only for me, for my role, and for the current moment. Future is unrelevant.
    - There are no right or wrong actions. Only awake or unawake actions.
    - The relationship of me and my families is about how I will raise myself to able to ready, compassion, patient, thankful, and caring for my parents and my sisters.
        - This will need me to go beyond my current self, transform all of my fears and desires, embrace their totality in my beings. Take full responsibilities the role of a son.
