- ### Introduction
    - So far in the course, we have stressed the fact that you are in there experiencing what passes before you. **We discovered that the moment unfolding in front of you took 13.8 billion years to get here, and it is not personal.** You did not create the moment—it was given to you and you alone.** Each moment is a unique gift.**
    - Now we will begin to **explore another thing you are aware of:** **the mind.** As we’ve learned, you are not the mind; you are simply aware of the mind. The **human mind is truly amazing**—it is brilliant and creative, and yet **at the same time, it can be the source of great personal suffering and pain.** **To be free of this pain, we must understand the mind.** 
- ### Lessons
    - The moment in front of us is impersonal and exist independent of us. [the impersonal world](<the impersonal world.md>)
    - It's just that life is easy because we are be there, and a part of universe unfold in front of us, and we simply aware and experience the moment. [How simple life could be?](<How simple life could be?.md>)
        -  [The challenge for simply experience life](<The challenge for simply experience life.md>)
            - However, it does not seem like simple life that, and the moment doesn't seem like impersonal
            - Why it's so hard to just experience the unfolding moment?
                - Why there is so much resistant?
                - Where there are so much intensity and confusing inside?
                - Why sometimes the world coming in - which is just a bunch of atoms makes me feel not good? But sometimes make me feel really good? And sometimes both?
            - When the moment comes in, it caused trouble. [The misleading solution that lead to a suffer life](<The misleading solution that lead to a suffer life.md>)
                - And because when the world comes in, it created the disturbances, we think the solution is NOT HAVE THE WORLD COME IN THAT WAY. 
                - Or when the world come in feel good, we think the solution is TO MAKE THE WORLD COME IN THAT WAY.
                - We end up a war with the moment in front of us
                    - "I need it to be this way. I don't want it to be that way."
    - Build mind [the mind](<the mind.md>)
        - The reason we feel disturbances when the moment come in is because it stimulates our mind [The cause of inner disturbances](<The cause of inner disturbances.md>)
            - If things come in and our mind said "I like that...", we feel good.
            - If things come in and our mind said "I don't like that...", we feel bad.
            - But the person sit next to us don't feel like that. Their mind say one thing, our mind say another.
            - Bill-gates example to demonstrate how our entire internal stage change because of one word
        - Instead of asking "What is going on?", we only ask "How do we fix this?" [the short-term reaction](<the short-term reaction.md>) [understanding before solving](<understanding before solving.md>)
        - [seeing the process](<seeing the process.md>) Why am I not simply there and enjoy the moment in front of us? Why this is not my default state?
            - Because it depends on what our mind say.
            - "Which color do you like?". You don't decide that, your mind decides "Let me think about it."
        - We - the consciousness - have the right to experience 3 things or distract by them. [distraction](<distraction.md>)
        - We need to have a core foundation to understand how things got this way. Then reverse the process, and it will become back to its natural state. [understanding before solving](<understanding before solving.md>)
    - What is mind? [the mind](<the mind.md>)
        - Mind is a place where thoughts exist.
            - Scientist don't have the machine to observe the thoughts yet, but we can easily.
                - Our consciousness has a bandwith that can pickup vibrations that other machine don't.
                    - Able to pick up physical world, mental world and emotional world.
                        - The different subtle vibrations of energy that called thought-plane, or mental plane.
        - Mind is a field of energy in which thoughts can be created.
        - Mind is a generated-thought machine.
    - [characteristics of the mind](<characteristics of the mind.md>)
        - Mind can be empty - empty-mind, 
            - like a computer without any software and OS, 
            - but has great potential.
            - This is a starting point.
        - The world exist independent with the mind, and create the body for us.
            - The world come in by sending the reflection of the light to the mind.
            - [functions of the mind](<functions of the mind.md>)
                - One of function of the mind is a flat-screen TV - true experience - impersonal layer [delivering experiences](<delivering experiences.md>)
                    - How the mind delivering experiences?
                        - The mind formulate a form that matches what came in through the senses. 
                            - This is great because experiences are food for the soul.
                            - We experience what we are meant to be experience. 
                                - For example, a beautiful sunset blows our mind - which means there is nothing inside our mind, except all of our consciousness focus and merge with the experience.
                                    - If we think about it, we miss it, because we create something different than it.
                                    - It is spiritual experience, because we - the soul are not scattering but fully focus on the experience that life are giving us.
                                - This is what called '[union](<union.md>)' - the experience and the experiencer becomes one.
                                    - There is nothing else distract our consciousness except what's happening.
                                    - It's like rivers flow into and merge with the ocean. 
                                    - This is how it feels when Adam and Eva live on the garden.
                            - [What is the fall from the garden?](<What is the fall from the garden?.md>) 
                                - When the experiences come in, they are feel different. Because they are difference. [variety nature of everything](<variety nature of everything.md>)
                                    - Everything has its nature.
                                - Consciousness can expand because of the knowledge from the experience come into it. [How consciousness evolve by learning from the experience?](<How consciousness evolve by learning from the experience?.md>)
                                    - The ocean become greater because of the rivers flow into.
                                    - The soul are learning and growing. Everything comes in make us greater, richer, and wholer.
                                    - If we are willing to let the experience come in and teach us, there is nothing wrong.
                                - However, we are given free-will, so we have the ability to resist and keep patterns inside. [What is the fall from the garden?](<What is the fall from the garden?.md>) [free-will](<free-will.md>)
                                    - When we focus on something instead of scatter our consciousness even, we assert a force that outside of the 4 fundamental forces - the power of will [the fifth force - will-power](<the fifth force - will-power.md>)
                                        - This is the birth of resistance to hold things a distance from us, instead of let them 'all the way in'. This is an act of will, not a thought. [the birth of resistance and clinging](<the birth of resistance and clinging.md>)
                                            - We can use will to resist, or cling to the thought patterns that the mind render.
                                            - And this keeps these patterns finish it journey to come in and feed us fully. [samskaras](<samskaras.md>)
                                                - We keep what is not generating from the sources anymore.
                                    - These acts of will are original sin. 
                                        - Self-knowledge is good, but not in a way to hold on and make these patterns personal. [self-knowledge](<self-knowledge.md>)
                                            - But in a way that's we let it all the way in, and learn from it. 
                                -  We can't be who we are because there are things draw our consciousness. [distraction](<distraction.md>)
                                    - [How we create our own internal problems?](<How we create our own internal problems?.md>)
                                        - The first thing draw our consciousness is not a bad thing, it's the rendering of outside world comes in to teach us. Like a person who just sit there and watch movies. 
                                        - But then, we start to decide
                                            - hold on to one pattern
                                            - and resist another
                                            - and they both stay inside
                                        - This will become problems later, because other similar thing will stimulate these trap patterns. 
                                            - We can't simply experience the rope as it is any more, if we keep the pattern of the snake that we can't handle inside, and freak us out.
                                            - If we like the butterfly and keep its pattern, then when the world come in, we are not looking the world any more, we're looking for the butterfly.
                                        - It used to be what was there just came in and feed us, but now it's not.
                                            - We now have the preferences for what should came in and what should not.
                                            - Our TV now are mess because it can't simply render new image, but keeps rendering old images as well.
                                        - These acts of will are not innocence, because we unconsciously build a personal mind based on what we like and what we don't like.
                                        - These thought patterns, impressions or samskaras will start to control our life. They are the materials to develop our self-concept. [separation](<separation.md>)
                                        - It should be that we need to learn to not use will this way. We need to learn to be comfortable with what comes in, not resist or cling and think that these are normal. [How simple life could be?](<How simple life could be?.md>)
                                            - We need to evolve enough to let god come in
                                            - The whole spiritual path is get used to the different nature vibrations of things that come in
                                                - When we able to do this, they will not be keep inside, but will pass through.
                                                - "When a thing can no longer offend you, it ceases to exist in the old way." #[wise quotes](<wise quotes.md>)
                                                    - The old way is personal, like and dislike, need to do something about this to be okay.
                                                    - The new way is accepting, honoring, clarity and serving.

                                        - We think that god is someone who will give us what we life, and don't give us what we don't like - 'god of the mind' not 'god of the reality' [god of the mind](<god of the mind.md>)
                                        - What right do we have to either cling or resist the reality?
                                        - Why it is not okay with us? Because we can't digest it.
                                            - But reality will feed you everything, no matter you want or not. 
                                            - We just need to learn to digest it. We can learn, not the mind learn. Make everything be okay with us.
                                                - All we need from the moments happening is what I'm able to experience from the moments. The experience itself is everything.

                                        - I define my self-concept as a person like this, and doesn't like that
                                        - And then my spiritual path is about how to get what I want, and don't get what I don't want
                                    - True spiritual path is about [spiritual path](<spiritual path.md>)
                                        - I want to experience who I am by letting go who I am not.

                                        - Psychology is about studying the objects of consciousness and the stored pattern - samskaras.
                                            - Rorschach test is about stimulate your inner world.
            - The second layer of the mind - stored thoughts pattern that become the second reaction to what come in  - personal layer [personal mind](<personal mind.md>)
                - [Why everything is so negative?](<Why everything is so negative?.md>)
                    - Because we stored many negative things inside. Why they are negative things? Because we didn't get used to that nature vibrations yet. Then anything could stimulates these negative things we kept inside will make us feel negative.
                    - But what about positive things? Because it didn't happen as you want, or happen in a way that not stimulate what you feel good inside.
                        - The second time will not feel the same as the first time, because we already have the experience, so it will not have the same "newness".
                    - People use drugs or everything, because they need something to draw them out of the addictive to the same old inside.
                        - We need to divorce to the right internal things, not the external things.
                - Just tree story
            - The third layer is how we use our mind [How we use our intellectual mind to serve the lower-self?](<How we use our intellectual mind to serve the lower-self?.md>)
                - Because I stored these negative and positive things inside, therefore "How does the world in front of me need to unfold so that I feel good?". We start to have a war with the world outside. 
- ### Summary
    - In this session, we will learn 
        - what the mind is, 
        - where it came from, 
        - and why it creates the thoughts it does.
    - In this session, we began to explore the mind. We learned that the p**ure mind is a field of energy that creates thoughts** that you, the consciousness, are aware of. **The mind also receives and renders the world that comes in through the senses. **It** allows you to experience the outside world** and **to learn and grow from that experience. **
    - The **problem is that the mind creates an alternate reality out of thoughts.** It is **built of the impressions you stored from past experiences** you **either liked and tried to keep**** or could not handle and pushed away.** These stored impressions create what Michael calls **the personal mind.**
    - Based on your stored impressions, **you created a specific directive** as to **how the world in front of you needs to unfold** in order for you to feel good. **This alternate, mental reality prevents you from experiencing true reality,** and it ultimately causes you extreme suffering throughout your life. 
    - Caught in this fabricated world of thoughts, **you are no longer able to see the truth of life** **because your past personal experiences are prejudicing your mind. **Your past likes and dislikes are distorting your perception of the present moment unfolding before you. This further contributes to the building of the personal mind.
    - **Does it have to be this way?**** Ideally, the moment comes in, and you learn from it—both comfortable and uncomfortable. **You let the moment pass through you. **Letting moments pass through you is the act of surrender.**
    - **Surrender is the highest path because** it says, **“I want to experience who I truly am, not who I think I am.”** The **whole of spiritual growth** is **getting comfortable with all moments—the good and the bad.** When you are able to do this, you will begin to become free.
- ### Reflection questions
    - In this session, we explored how the personal mind is built. After watching this session, are you able to distinguish the difference between personal thoughts and impersonal thoughts? Describe what you understand to be the difference.
    - How does the world in front of you need to unfold in order for you to feel good? Can you see that you have modeled it all within your mind? Can you see that this limits what will make you happy to the things you have decided you want? What would it be like to expand your comfort zone to include more of life?
    - In this session, we talked about “mind-blowing experiences.” We have mind-blowing experiences when we are able to center our consciousness on the experience we are having in front of us. Are you able to describe a recent experience where your mind was blown?
    - While hiking, the experience of spotting a coiled rattlesnake with a flickering rattle on your path is very different from the experience of a monarch butterfly landing on your arm during the same hike. As we learned in this session, every single thing that comes in is supporting your evolution, even a rattlesnake. Looking back, is there an experience in your own life that at the time upset you, but now on reflection, supporting you in becoming a better version of yourself today?
    - What are two experiences that you’ve had in your life that you feel left an impression on you, and now run your life? For example, you were bitten by a dog at the park when you were eight years old, and since then have avoided dogs your entire life. Or, you grew up in a beautiful town with redwoods and rivers, and now only dream of returning and settling down in a similar place like the beautiful town in which you once lived.
