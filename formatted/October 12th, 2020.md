- This morning I felt that I started to lift up some samskaras that deeply hold inside of myself about [inconvenient](<inconvenient.md>), about the need to separation. I noticed how these urges, these tendencies that pulls me out of myself. [tendency](<tendency.md>) [inner urge](<inner urge.md>)
- I start to learn how to operate myself to [oneness](<oneness.md>) instead of the old way [separation](<separation.md>). For example, 
    - how I could use Roam Research without the need to create [hard border](<hard border.md>) for different things?
    - how I could think life as [oneness](<oneness.md>) without the need to separate them to work, life, love, family...?
    - One of the way that emerge inside of me now is [contextual mastery](<contextual mastery.md>). Look think in context instead of separation. Because everything is connected, just in a different context. 

This kind of way of seeing life is shifting from [separation](<separation.md>) to moment, to [situational context](<situational context.md>).
- The feelings that inside of me merge to each other instead of splitting feel so good. [self-fulfilled](<self-fulfilled.md>)
- I saw that I want to learn the way of establish myself into seat of awareness like [Thích Nhất Hạnh](<Thích Nhất Hạnh.md>), [Minh Niệm](<Minh Niệm.md>), [Michael Singer](<Michael Singer.md>) and measure its success by express it to external world. [establishing the seat of awareness](<establishing the seat of awareness.md>) [external expressions](<external expressions.md>)
- [funny](<funny.md>) Em là một ngã rẽ. Vì gặp em là chỉ muốn cua. [riddle](<riddle.md>)
- [funny](<funny.md>) yếu sinh lý là học Sinh và Lý yếu
- [double down](<double down.md>) versus [double up](<double up.md>) 
I just realized that I have not fully orient myself to [double up](<double up.md>) way of living. 
    - This is a way of living that fully shift from the first down is [resisting](<resisting.md>) and [clinging](<clinging.md>) to [learning](<learning.md>) to [enjoy the learning experience](<enjoy the learning experience.md>) and completing learning them. 

The benefit of this is not waste energy to resist and cling to [samskaras](<samskaras.md>).
    - The second down is from not sure what need to do and keep build up the [samskaras](<samskaras.md>), keep harness the power of resistance and make us not able to access the [inner flow of energy](<inner flow of energy.md>).

So basically, I'm not just wasting my energy to maintain the dam, I also lost the source of energy to recharge.
    - [double up](<double up.md>) will happen when I let myself the courage to fully experiences and then release it whether it's good or bad, it's comfortable or uncomfortable. No judgment, just fully experiences. 

This will lead to the [soul evolution](<soul evolution.md>) to become wholer and keep the [inner flow of energy](<inner flow of energy.md>) flowing to myself.
    - I still have many [judgment](<judgment.md>) that based on [separation](<separation.md>) hold me back from experiences. These kind of thoughts prevent me to let myself embrace the experiences fully.
- I felt that I start to clean my [inconvenient](<inconvenient.md>) samskaras, and realized that everything is already here. It didn't happened for my convenience, but for everyone and for me as well. It will be very inconvenient if there is nothing exist, so I can't [take for granted](<take for granted.md>) anything.
    - I start to feel more [abundance appreciation](<abundance appreciation.md>) for the fact that things are exist though it's not always making feel good. And it's my job for learning to fully appreciate this fact instead of being cheat by my personal mind.
    - I felt that I also start to develop [compassion](<compassion.md>) and easier to [forgive](<forgive.md>) other people when they are making me uncomfortable. I start to take my [personal responsibilities](<personal responsibilities.md>) for my own stuffs and direct myself to the truth that life is perfect, there is nothing wrong. [There is nothing wrong, only the lack of wisdom](<There is nothing wrong, only the lack of wisdom.md>)
- [x] I will work for editing Michael Singer's course a little bit, around 20 minute from now. 
- When I'm working to edit, I felt an accumulation of stress and uncomfortable sensations that emerge inside me. It's like there is stuff trying to go out and get hit. And I'm easy to focus on it instead of focus on the work itself [distraction](<distraction.md>) [accumulated stress](<accumulated stress.md>)
    - So in order for [flow](<flow.md>) to happen or maintain, it would be great if 
        - there is nothing accumulate when working - this is [long-term solutions](<long-term solutions.md>) [natural progression](<natural progression.md>)
        - or I focus enough on the work and not get distract by the stuffs that emerge - [short-term solutions](<short-term solutions.md>) [focus mode](<focus mode.md>)
- I felt that my [impersonal desires](<impersonal desires.md>) are experiences without the need to satisfy any needs inside of myself. [interests](<interests.md>)
    - I am [complement](<complement.md>) myself so that I could be at least somehow ready than ever to become a good [life partner](<life partner.md>) and a good father or a good [supporter](<supporter.md>) for my child on their journey on the earth.
- I felt that I and [Nguyễn Mỹ Linh](<Nguyễn Mỹ Linh.md>) are not separate too much like the past. I  don't know whether we will become a [life partner](<life partner.md>) for each other or not, but I just want to support her as best as possible.  
- For my parents, I want to love them as they are, instead of trying to please them with their [personal needs](<personal needs.md>) as this is the indirect way to solve the true problems. [work at the root](<work at the root.md>)
- Instead of focus teaching on the knowledge, I could do better if I could describe more about how the process of our [feelings](<feelings.md>) will occurs. [training method](<training method.md>)
- [level of development](<level of development.md>) because everything has levels of development, from the easiest to most complicated, it's good to practice slowly from each level and increase the difficulty gradually.
