    - I start learn to let it go, let whatever the mind say go, let whatever comes up in the heart go. I notice that it's important to always purify, and gradually I will able to contact more with reality. To lean into reality or lean into the self, and leave the mind as I want.
    - The center of my life will need to change, it's the seat of awareness and reality, not the mind.
- I notice that I start to feel more comfortable and more presence when interact with my parents. Though still many things need to clean related into my family, but the progress is starting to noticeable.
