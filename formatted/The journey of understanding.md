- This is the process of absorb external knowledge, develop personal knowledge and package them to personal wisdom
- Data
    - External knowledge (books, articles, courses, experiences...)
- Information - meaningful data
    - Highlights, summary, key take-aways
- Knowledge - pattern recognition and self-understanding
    - New insights, new awareness, self-reflection, pop-up understanding
    - High-quality information blocks / evergreen notes/ MOCs
- Wisdom - the package of personal knowledge that comes from deeply understand the essence of something or a truth
    - Personal articles, courses books, sharing talks
    - watering ideas, seeds
    - cleaning [clustering](<clustering.md>) weeds
    - wither, resurface or flourish seeds
    - **Streams** - For me this is twitter and is more than enough stream for now.
    - **Campfires** - For me this is the blog here (and more broadly the blogosphere that I read and engage with). Room to grow here but generally I’m satisfied here.
    - **Gardens** - This is where there’s a gap for me personally. No place to store and evolve deeper longer-term thinking. Many of my friends have gravitated to [Are.na](https://are.na/) but I just can’t get it to work for me.
