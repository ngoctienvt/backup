- It's clear to me that any thoughts that manifesting is the results of the forces that comes mostly from the samskaras, and not my intention to think in that direction. I just follow the lead of the manifesting thoughts at that moment and think that they are coming from my intention. So the main point here is learning to release any unconscious thoughts to release the samskaras that creating forces rather than follow these thoughts.
    - If I manage to let the mind become still and empty, I will be free from these unconscious forces and will be able to use the mind as I want.
- I notice that the journey of practicing to free myself help me to gain insights in different perspectives and way of seeings. From that I could integrate them into myself and see the way that I could lead other people into the journey properly, depend on where they are at. 
    - Because only in certain stages, we will be able to understand what we learnt that before we can't understand them, since we are far away from that.
