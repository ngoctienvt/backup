- I noticed that I need to establish a new way of looking life. It's not that there is time I work, other time I don't work. The fact is I always do something, this is a [continuous process](<continuous process.md>) with no stop at all. I just transition from one work to another work, from an intentional work to unconscious work. Once I still not aware and work fully on my unconscious work, I still will be trying non-stop to overcome that unconscious instead of working on it to direct myself fully to the flow that I want to live with.

- Recently I woke up quite fast, because I realized the thought or the dream that I identified with much easier, so I can choose to withdraw out of it. However, I still feel lazy to get out of my bed, because I still feel that I want to sleep a bit more, since my body got cold and I want to relax and release accumulated stress on my body first.
