- When we feel most stuck and helpless, it’s because we’ve bought into the idea that our choices, and choices alone, determine the outcomes of our lives. Our real choosing power is actually how we respond to what we didn’t choose. __The way we react to the reality that is in front of us is how we invent the next reality we will experience.__  [Surrend to the truth of the world](<Surrend to the truth of the world.md>)

- This week my major samskaras related to my need for protecting what's important to me. [need for protection](<need for protection.md>) It's a big thing that related to my Tiến's principle sub-personality that it based on what I trust on what's the right thing. And I need to let go these needs and embrace the what's truly the right thing. [Surrend to the truth of the world](<Surrend to the truth of the world.md>)

- I noticed that I need to establish a new way of looking life. It's not that there is time I work, other time I don't work. The fact is I always do something, this is a [continuous process](<continuous process.md>) with no stop at all. I just transition from one work to another work, from an intentional work to unconscious work. Once I still not aware and work fully on my unconscious work, I still will be trying non-stop to overcome that unconscious instead of working on it to direct myself fully to the flow that I want to live with.

- [unattachment](<unattachment.md>) is the first thing that we need to master, and it's not just about our true self and the things on us, but are able to see this on other people as well. [Surrend to the truth of the world](<Surrend to the truth of the world.md>)

- If we look outside, we see problems. If we look inside, we see the part we're unable to handle yet. [Surrend to the truth of the world](<Surrend to the truth of the world.md>)
