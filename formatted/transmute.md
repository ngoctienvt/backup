- I realized that I have a tendency to react with what comes into mind that want to change me in an undesire direction from my early childhood. The case with Hương is only a part of this thing. My sister and my family also makes me feel that I need to protect myself so I can be myself, and as a result, I build up the tendency to protect and resist instead of let external things come in and [transmute](<transmute.md>)
