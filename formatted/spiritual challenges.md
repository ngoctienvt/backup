- What's the challenge? [spiritual challenges](<spiritual challenges.md>)

- **The problem** is **we don’t experience life from that place of awareness.** Throughout our lives, **we have been lost** in our outside world—the people, the places, the things, and the experiences—as well as in our thoughts and emotions, **all in an attempt to make ourselves be and feel OK.** When we **learn to center back** into the seat of awareness, **we will find ourselves, and we can begin the path of surrender.** [spiritual challenges](<spiritual challenges.md>)
