    - In visioning session, some main activities will be hold to reach these purposes
        - Participants have a clearer overall view about their life
            - The movie of their life - the name of that movie
            - Sharing what's new they have about their life
        - Participants see how they will able to grow and wholer over time
            - The expanding activities in which people will identify 
                - What they are doing and will doing in short-term
                - What skills they want to develop in short-term
                - Then, vision to future and see what they are doing and having at that moment? What skills they want to develop next? (Assuming that everything they want now is fulfilled and achieved)
            - The activity is quite effective because it helps participants to fulfill the picture to be able to bring it to further, rather than having to worry about how they will able to do. This is another challenge that will need to address further.
            - One main thing that I'm still concern is "is that enough?". Because it doesn't mention how they will develop their strengths and state of being. But these internal thing is hard to address and focus. They will grow along the journey that they are walking instead.
                - One approach could be about addressing "What fears and desires you want to resolve in short-term?". This is okay, and I could test in today.
        - Participants can connect with their tree life to see how it will develop overtime.

    - After visioning session, it's important to address the process they will come to achieve them, so that it's not just the goal, but they could see how they will connect to the journey to reach the goal. 
    - It's a little hard to do this, because just like coaching, we don't know how it will need to process for each people. But there are some principles that share for everyone
        - The journey will require us to grow and expand into uncomfortable zone
        - It's also require us to "learn to walk in the unknown"
        - The way is not linear, so we could only see few steps as a time, and walk each step into the unknown
        - There will be a out and in period of time - out for creating, expanding, growing - in for internalizing, reflecting, embracing, cleaning, preparing
        - There will be mentors along the way
        - Some qualities will need to develop in each people: faith, brave, courage, trust, patience, love, non-attachment, care for other, curious,...
