- The bridge between coaching and spirituality for me is somehow about the bridge between
    - Working at the root versus working at what clients concern/care about at the moment
    - It's also important that coaching is not about solving the problems successfully, but rather about supporting clients to work with their stuffs while improving their capacity to develop a deeper awareness, a way of seeing, a capacity to work at the root.
        - The journey will take time for clients to go deep inside yourself, and the coach need to always pay attention to where clients at to help them progress further.
        - It's important to not let the coach's attachments to the results or to the outcomes to hinder the journey of development of clients. 
        - Coaching is a progressing journey rather than a work to complete.
            - A coach could guide sometimes, but not rush clients to achieve the outcome or work at what the coach see. It's all about connecting with clients to help them expand their horizontal awareness.
