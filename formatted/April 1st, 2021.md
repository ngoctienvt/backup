- The human relationship has been a difficult part for me to handle and resolve. I have been a person who try to have the best answer for human interaction. It's simple if I'm not directly related, but when I become the main character in the events, I feel so much stressful, pressure, and my mind is so active to figure out the answer. This is one of the most challenge lesson for me in my own spiritual path. But when I can handle this, my life will become much much more simple and freedom. I will commit to work through this.
