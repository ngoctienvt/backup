- The more I write, the more things integrate inside myself, and the more I feel I can ready to move to the next level as well. [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

## [October 13th, 2020](<October 13th, 2020.md>)
- I felt that the reason I want to have speakers is that I like to be on [diffuse mode](<diffuse mode.md>). Headphone mainly I want to use for [focus mode](<focus mode.md>). There is a [separation](<separation.md>) for these 2 ways of living of myself. And now I am starting to learn how to integrate focus mode to my diffuse mode. [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

- The hardest part of [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>) is still about how to utilize the [focus mode](<focus mode.md>) to use my time effectively. The difficulty is still about I feel the [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) to learn like writing all of what I learn from the books is okay, but it's not maximize and fully effective if I just learn knowledge without starting to integrate it at the same time.

## [October 14th, 2020](<October 14th, 2020.md>)
But now I still need to make [conscious choice](<conscious choice.md>) to keep myself working on [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

- In [being mode](<being mode.md>), I will able to connect my inner energy to get in touch with reality, instead of being block by inner [samskaras](<samskaras.md>) [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>).

- The hard part is this kind of connection is not stable at the moment, and in the early stage of [being mode](<being mode.md>), I will work on how to establish this connection in a stable way. [diffuse mode](<diffuse mode.md>) is very important here, because this is when I clean the blockages with relaxation and [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>).

- Is it said clearly?  to ensure that it's easy to understand and digest [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

- Is it said beautifully? to ensure that it's easy to integrate [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

- [From separation to union life](<From separation to union life.md>) [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

## [October 20th, 2020](<October 20th, 2020.md>)
- The [soul-guidance](<soul-guidance.md>) will base on the [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>),

## [October 21st, 2020](<October 21st, 2020.md>)
- the shift from [exclusion](<exclusion.md>) to [inclusion](<inclusion.md>) attitude is very important because only by inclusion, the thing can become [wholer](<wholer.md>) and simpler at the same time. [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>).

## [October 23rd, 2020](<October 23rd, 2020.md>)
- It's very important for me to relax to fully [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

- While learning from external sources will provide input, I need the [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

- personal development oriented - [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

- I felt much clearer now, though they are still a mess because it's not easy to merge these things, the whole point is for something new to emerge, there need to be the [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

- logseq is just where I put my inner work to store it out. It's not where the work actually happens. It supports me, but the true work is the [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

## [October 25th, 2020](<October 25th, 2020.md>)
- For the next period of time, my whole [willpower](<willpower.md>) will use to direct myself to improve my ability to integrate things. [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

- I felt that my morning routines would need to take up too much willpower, but rather cleaning my clustering, doing mindless activities first. I will spend time for [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

## [October 26th, 2020](<October 26th, 2020.md>)
- I will handle them progressively through the [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

## [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>)
- focuses on now with [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)

## [natural progression](<natural progression.md>)
- [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>)
