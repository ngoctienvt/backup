- I felt kind of tired when I still dream so much and can't wake up. I'm not asserting my will power to get up and be myself, but let myself drowning on the release of samskaras. I will try to wake up and support the process of releasing inner samskaras. [willpower](<willpower.md>) [samskaras](<samskaras.md>).

I will also wear long-hand clothes at night so that I can protect my arm. [physical body](<physical body.md>)
- I noticed that I still have a happy feeling when [@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh](<@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh.md>) accept my invitation for talking with each other.
- I have a bit [worry](<worry.md>) about my physical energy today. Because I will have one teaching, and one learning workshop. But I think it will be fine, as long as I'm conscious and managing my energy properly. [energy management](<energy management.md>)
- I also noticed that I couldn't just do my all of my [thinking process](<thinking process.md>) 
    - by writing in Roam Research, 
    - sometimes I will need to draw by hand, to draw chart, and see the pictures
    - or need to try and test to gain new practical information
- I feel that it will take time for me to truly practice my spiritual path first. I will focus on [🌲PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System ](<🌲PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System .md>) and coaching for the next period of time. And still spend time for my own to free myself first. I will learn to master and support others while I'm mastering things as well. But at least I need to go further ahead enough so that's I can become a proper tour guide for them. [training method](<training method.md>) [light house](<light house.md>)
- I felt much more calm and peaceful these days, it became much more natural to relax and release. I also noticed that I still have some resistance when learning online by Zoom and interacting with strangers, it's time for me to release these resistances and trust the process to unfold. It's time to learn to nurture [humility](<humility.md>) and to enjoy the varities of life.
- I also learned in today that I don't have to worry about what I need to do, as long as I'm keep raising my energy to higher center, it will do its work instead of me. I will just need to be myself most of the time. [choiceless](<choiceless.md>) [serving the demand of reality](<serving the demand of reality.md>)

-  I felt a little bit [restless](<restless.md>) inside myself. There are a few things that I still feel worried if I disturb other people while they're sharing. There is a feeling of worry about the speakers get problems and need to fix. I have a concern if I should join their [instructional design](<instructional design.md>) or not. Because I still want to learn on my own, and whether if the teaching is worth my time and money.
