I will try to wake up and support the process of releasing inner samskaras. [willpower](<willpower.md>) [samskaras](<samskaras.md>).

I will also wear long-hand clothes at night so that I can protect my arm. [physical body](<physical body.md>)
- I noticed that I still have a happy feeling when [@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh](<@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh.md>) accept my invitation for talking with each other.
- I have a bit [worry](<worry.md>) about my physical energy today. Because I will have one teaching, and one learning workshop. But I think it will be fine, as long as I'm conscious and managing my energy properly. [energy management](<energy management.md>)
- I also noticed that I couldn't just do my all of my [thinking process](<thinking process.md>) 
    - by writing in Roam Research, 
    - sometimes I will need to draw by hand, to draw chart, and see the pictures
    - or need to try and test to gain new practical information
