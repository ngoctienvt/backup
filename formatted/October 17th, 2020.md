- When reading novels, I realize that I also have many
limitations on my belief system. [limiting thoughts](<limiting thoughts.md>)

of surrender]]
- Today I want to keep myself with [[bottom-up approach, I
fully experience the moments and then I will know what I need to do next. I
will stop [living in the future](<living in the future.md>) or at least know that I need to come back to
now, because everything is already here that I need to understand and fully
experience them first.  [current working](<current working.md>)
- I felt so much fun when teaching and also [deeper understanding](<deeper understanding.md>) for myself from today spiritual lessons. It's very satisfying
when seeing people learning the [hard-truth](<hard-truth.md>). Because this pain is what
really needs to confront and will give true solutions for true happiness.
- [concise](<concise.md>) is about clear intention, enough and trust the
process.
- Today coaching with [Nguyễn Mỹ Linh](<Nguyễn Mỹ Linh.md>), I would like to have
a far step-back to let her tell more and I will listen more to really
understand and establish a deep connection with her first. I will also let go
of any top-down agendas so that I can fully meet her at where she was and help
her from that position instead.
- It's about [[meet people
where they are]] instead of where I think they should be.
- I also want my language
will be more [concise](<concise.md>) instead of explaining or talking too much.
- I realize that when what I like to attach with a comeback to
me, I start to try to grab and cling to it as best as possible. Instead of just
let things be and raise it up naturally without any attachments. [living from the place of surrender](<living from the place of surrender.md>) [unattachment](<unattachment.md>)
- [ ] Coaching
[Nguyễn Thúy Hằng](<Nguyễn Thúy Hằng.md>) [Oct 29th, 2020](<Oct 29th, 2020.md>)
- [ ] Coaching [Nguyễn Mỹ Linh](<Nguyễn Mỹ Linh.md>) [Nov 1st, 2020](<Nov 1st, 2020.md>)
- [ ] Coaching [Lý Kim Ngân](<Lý Kim Ngân.md>) [Oct 26th, 2020](<Oct 26th, 2020.md>)
- Planning for next next week:
    - 
    - [ ] refining [morning rituals](<morning rituals.md>)
    - [ ] editing video 6
    - [ ] resolving some of relationship attachments
- [spiritual practices](<spiritual practices.md>) The hard part of spirituality is not
about the practices or time, but about the choice of handle or resist, of
release or cling.
- I felt so much tired and want to less do sexual things due
to the exhaustion of [physical energy](<physical energy.md>).
- [being mode](<being mode.md>) is the mode that emphasizes on centering on
the seat of awareness and [relaxing](<relaxing.md>) to let go any resistance or
attachments.
- [morning rituals](<morning rituals.md>) It would be easier to meditation first,
then do personal activities later.
- My thoughts about [natural progression](<natural progression.md>) now focus
on how to integrate everything that is not yet handled, so I could fully
present at now first. [living in the future](<living in the future.md>) or [living in the past](<living in the past.md>) is
just the result of clinging and resisting that keep the [samskaras](<samskaras.md>) stuck
inside.
- So there is two kinds of now or present moment [now](<now.md>)
    - One is the now that I focus on the moment in front of me and the current relationship of me and that moment
    - The second is to focus on my inner thoughts, emotions, and sensations that are distracting me from the moment in front of me.
    - [living in the present](<living in the present.md>) is not about choosing the first or second now but about union the second now with me, so that I could fully present with the first now that are always unfolding and changing.
- [integration](<integration.md>) [transformation](<transformation.md>) What I need to integrate and develop new way of living are:
    - [habit-formed will](<habit-formed will.md>)
    - [emotions](<emotions.md>)
    - thoughts - [union thoughts](<union thoughts.md>)
    - languages - [generating languages](<generating languages.md>)
    - behaviors - [helpful manner](<helpful manner.md>)
    - way of thinking
- [deep coaching](<deep coaching.md>) In deep coaching, it's important to notice the intersection that makes clients going out instead of work on themselves. It's the part that they can't handle inside so they use outside to serve as a solution. [reflection](<reflection.md>)
    - For instance, if a client want to have a higher salary, it's because there is a part inside of them that want to have a higher salary so that it will not feel uncomfortable or stuck inside.
    - Pointing to the right part is very important because it will [evoke awareness](<evoke awareness.md>) that directly relate to what client need to deal with.
- [living in the present](<living in the present.md>) I have a sensation about building up this thing is like I connect with all of the earth that below me (past experiences, my accumulated self, my past journey...) that are integrated and easy to relate with. Then I will just continue to build up myself from that based on [demand of reality](<demand of reality.md>) instead of worrying about where I need to go to. [bottom-up approach [[being mode](<bottom-up approach [[being mode.md>) 
- And if I want to connect with others deeply, I also need to just not see what's above the earth but understand what below it. [deep connection](<deep connection.md>) Without true understanding, it's very easy for my mind to make its own interpretation and make me trust those very low possibilities to true interpretations.
    - [the accumulated self](<the accumulated self.md>)
    - [demand of reality](<demand of reality.md>)
    - ### willpower to direct myself to [meeting the demand of reality](<meeting the demand of reality.md>)
- [self-fulfilled](<self-fulfilled.md>) is the highest intention that I want to
meet my [inner demand of reality](<inner demand of reality.md>). I don't want to let any external things
responsible for my inner container. I still feel grateful, enjoy, honor, but
not put the responsibility on them. [personal responsibilities](<personal responsibilities.md>)
- The process to grow my knowledge will be have different levels [knowledge development process](<knowledge development process.md>) [evergreen garden](<evergreen garden.md>)
    - Simply reading
    - Take notes interesting concepts, ideas, understanding - raw
materials without the need to connect to my own system [raw knowledges](<raw knowledges.md>)
    - process these notes to my own understanding - creating
ideas, concepts nodes and relate them to my own system [processed knowledges](<processed knowledges.md>)
    - continue developing these ideas and concepts over time
through experiences, note-taking, connecting - [mature knowledges](<mature knowledges.md>)
    - creating articles, condensing wisdom from these refined
materials [generative wisdom](<generative wisdom.md>)
- When bathing, I noticed that how I look at and name things is different depends on the view [point of focus](<point of focus.md>) [rules for naming](<rules for naming.md>) [generating languages](<generating languages.md>)
    - results - be clean inside
    - process or actions - integration
    - meaning - evolution
- I felt kind of uncomfortable when playing with drift joy-con because it feels [inconvenient](<inconvenient.md>) and not meet the minimum standards that are not faulty. [personal standards](<personal standards.md>)
- It seems like for buying necessary things. Half of the price that I feel comfortable to pay is a good way to make choice. [the middle way](<the middle way.md>)
- There is an intersection between [self-learning](<self-learning.md>) and learning from the [external knowledge](<external knowledge.md>) is that it focuses on solving the current [demand of reality](<demand of reality.md>)  which is the current context. [contextual mastery](<contextual mastery.md>)
    - [self-learning](<self-learning.md>) come to context with a [[bottom-up approach attitude.
    - [external knowledge](<external knowledge.md>) help to optimize the situation from a [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>)
- [From separation to union life](<From separation to union life.md>) [integration](<integration.md>) [natural progression](<natural progression.md>)
    - The societies split life into many different aspects
        - Work, life, social, entertainment, spiritual...
        - Physics, Math, Biology,...
        - father, son, colleague, friend, trainer, coach...
    - It's helpful to split things down so we can perform ourselves on that role and learn to master these roles separately. However, it's also unconsciously create hard [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) and split our trueself to many different aspects.
    - There is only one life, there is no hard-boundary in life. The splitting is the result of human mind and our job is not to believe that how it works. The truth is life are one.
    - All of the words that based on [separation](<separation.md>) mindset is work-life balance, coach, trainer, father, mother, son, boyfriend, girl friend, roles,...
