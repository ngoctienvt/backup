- An MOC is just a note — a very special type of note. It uses proximity effectively and acts like a tag and a non-exclusive folder at the same time.
    - Tag-like: It groups the links of associated notes in a non-exclusive way. (The notes themselves live freely elsewhere.)
    - Folder-like: It assembles notes in a tightly-packed grouping.
    - Proximity: It grants you the ability to deliberately position each note in relation to the other notes.
- Map of contents's metaphor
    - Using MOCs is like being in your own warehouse full of workbenches, where each workbench contains a selection of highly curated index cards for you to engage with.
    - Another way to consider MOCs is through emergence.
        - MOCs are Evergreen notes, just at the next level of emergence.
        - In an MOC, the party is always happening. It’s the “room where it happens.” Individual notes can “shadow-clone” themselves and essentially be in multiple parties simultaneous — interacting and developing complexity from each party at the same time!
- A Home Note
    - The highest-level of your zettelkasten / digital library. It has links to the main MOCs in your library along with your most relevant tags.
- 3 phase of MOCs
    - 1. **Assembling Phase**: *Collect, Curate, Incubate* - Put related stuff on a new digital workbench.
        - (1) [Habits MOC - Assembling Phase|Assembling Phase](<Habits MOC - Assembling Phase|Assembling Phase.md>): Imagine having a warehouse of limitless workbenches, and for each workbench, you curate the notes placed on it. Whenever you feel you need to get a handle on a bunch of notes Subject XYZ,  just throw them all onto a new workbench—i.e. place their links into a new MOC note titled `Subject XYZ MOC`. Now it's easier to begin.
    - 2. **Colliding Phase**: *Battle, Collide, Dismember, Combine, Craft, Discover* - Have your ideas battle for relational positioning. This is the most joyous and valuable stage.
        - (2) [Habits MOC - Colliding Phase|Colliding Phase](<Habits MOC - Colliding Phase|Colliding Phase.md>): Once you have all your ideas in one MOC, use it like a crucible where ideas can battle it out for positioning, forcing you to grind them to their fundamental essence—thinking of their proximal importance to each other and building stronger connective tissue between them. Great work is accomplished during in this conceptual battle royale. The product of this work is rarely one without satisfaction.
            - (2b) As you position these related notes, you might naturally form something that looks like a Table of Contents (TOC). TOCs are specific and linear. Depending on the project, you might need one as you get closer to a final product.
            - **Map of Content = MOC** - Use these as a thinking tool and to structure your digital library
            - **Table of Contents = TOC** - Use these to structure more specific, near-final projects in a single, linear way
    - 3. **Unifying Phase**: *Enjoy and Use* - Enjoy the spatial constellation you created out of concepts. It most likely is meaningful to you. Use it for different purposes: for final products (content creation), as a reference point in the future, or for the inherent joy the ideas provide.
        - (3) [Habits MOC|Unifying Phase](<Habits MOC|Unifying Phase.md>): As you finish work on an area of interest, the MOC remains as a renewable summation of thought for the future you. An MOC is your easy access point back into the topic—whether that's tomorrow or in ten years.
