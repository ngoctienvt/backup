- I felt so [restless](<restless.md>) about the [Hades game](<Hades game.md>) because it's enjoyable, fun to play and didn't punish much. It makes me think about setting up for success in coaching and training. Because the soul will learn lessons in a much enjoyable way instead of digest too big things at once. [setting up for success](<setting up for success.md>) It also makes the consequences are less negative so the risk can take much easier and it has different levels of difficulty to adjust with. 
- I also dreamt quite a bit last night and I felt that releasing in dream is not easy because I don't have intention to conscious at that moment. [dream](<dream.md>)
- When playing [Hades game](<Hades game.md>), I noticed that I have the need to skip the mundane tasks and want to learn the best possible or most effective way that I could do instead of simply enjoy the game fast. This urge for effective makes me feel [restless](<restless.md>) and want to rush through the experience that accumulated so much stress inside of me. [emotions](<emotions.md>)

The reason is I have a [hidden intention](<hidden intention.md>) to grasp the big picture and understand everything as soon as possible and focus on the [effective result](<effective result.md>) in an unattachment way.

I would like to shift this [hidden intention](<hidden intention.md>) to another [intention](<intention.md>) is 
    - To complete [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>) as [a way to effective mastery](<a way to effective mastery.md>) in a smaller picture.
    - To enjoy the process and to learn as a way to improve the enjoyment is a bigger picture. [enjoy the process](<enjoy the process.md>)
- In [coaching session](<coaching session.md>), it would be really helpful to discover the goal that really matters with clients. It's the meaningful results for clients instead of focusing on what they are only concern now.

For a singular coaching session, we can always work to help clients deal with what they are dealing with at the moment, and in the exploration process, we will discover some deeper things that we can go in-depth later.
- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) In the session of Dr. Cherie with Pat, she demonstrated the way she used reflections to make things clearer, and she also acknowledge the strength of Pat drawing from her success and asked how she can use this to handle bigger things. [reflection](<reflection.md>) [acknowledgment](<acknowledgment.md>) 
- It became much clearer for me that now is the time for me to really learn the lesson connects with reality in a slow-motion way so that I could see clearly what happens and improves myself at the moment instead of only able to replay them back after that. [life lessons](<life lessons.md>) [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>) [pay attention](<pay attention.md>). The need for a short-term result that is the main reason for making me unable to slow down. 
- I feel there is an urge inside of me that wants to talk about the relationship of me with Mỹ Linh, it's like it wants to tell the world that I could be high if I have a relationship with the person I want. And now, I - the witness conscious - don't want to depend on Linh to open my heart. I want to open it by myself. I want to proud of myself, do my own work to free myself instead of letting her do that job [personal needs](<personal needs.md>). [true love](<true love.md>) If there is love that will happen between here and me. I want to let it happen naturally and purest as possible. 
- I still wonder about the difference between [preferences](<preferences.md>) and the fact that the soul like to be high. Is it not a preference as well? And is it not because of that preference that makes the soul try to be high? The point is the soul like to be high is not really a problem, but the way it does to achieve is a problem.

Just like if you want to have a good meal, do your job to have a good meal instead of control others and make them responsible for your preferences. 

[preferences](<preferences.md>) in the teaching of Michael Singer is preferences about the vibration energy of things in reality that we are like or dislike. While the soul is energy and it really loves high-quality energy which comes from the shakti. 
- [life flow](<life flow.md>) To have an effective and meaningful life, we need to not just live right with the [flow of life](<flow of life.md>) but learn how to utilize it as well. And one thing important is to have a system that we can trust to support our mind out of the task of remembering and gathering information. [support system](<support system.md>)
    - A good structure enables [flow](<flow.md>).
    - We don’t need to use plan as it imposes structure on us, but we create a structure that generates insights and ideas so it can become the driving forces for creation.

- I still felt a little [worry](<worry.md>) about the coaching session with Linh. I still have some attachments here but not sure what it's really is. It's like I'm talking with a person higher than me and will be judge based on my behaviors or performance. [judgment](<judgment.md>). I will work on this tomorrow.
