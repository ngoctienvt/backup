- [üìùWeekly Review](<üìùWeekly Review.md>)
    - Highlights:
        - I start to understand deeper and have a broader vision about how life actually is. 
        - I start to understand that I'm focusing on the journey to come home, and neglect the part of navigate from that place.
            - This will be a big task to complete, but the result will be worthwhile.
        - I start to become less needy, less judge, less react, though still have many habit form patterns because the path is not clear and come down to action level yet. The navigation state is not complete yet.
        - I start to realize that instead of attach to self-concept, there will be a way to interact with life without the need to have these attachments. Some process, method, approach will not be attachments, but act as effective tools to deal with life manifesting instead.
    - Some of the main works for next week
        - Working more on establishing a solid navigation or orienting system.
        - Letting go self-concept and transition into system, orient tools, orient system without attachments
        - Stretch to response and serve life. For example, supporting more coaching clients. Giving back what I don't use or need any more.
