- I notice that I have the need to prove myself, to be recognize, and it comes from the fact that I’m not being acknowledge by surroundings from childhood. It’s now time for me to let go and learn to embrace the suffer that I’m holding on the past. It’s time for me to enjoy life, live in the moment, and trust the unknown, trust life is perfect and no need me to take the responsibilities to fix it.
- For the group coaching session next, it’s better if I could relax, do my best, and focus to be presence, enjoy the ride and learn from the experiences. Even if no one like or satisfy, it’s fine, I don’t have to be disappoint or make unnecessary pressure for myself, but rather learn to feel gratitude, feel enough, feel unattach instead.
