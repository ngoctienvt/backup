- Last night I dreamt about the fear of being wrong and making other people disappointed.
- [batching methodology](<batching methodology.md>) I started to be able to break doing activities to a different type of tasks
    - Reading and take-noting
    - Grouping
    - Tagging
    - Reread and structuring
- [ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach](<ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach.md>) also works for [Creating phase](<Creating phase.md>). 
    - I could list 
        - areas 
        - topics 
        - and then works on multiple articles at once
    - Because depend on the ideas, the stages, the understanding that I have, I could nurture these posts and complete them slowly based on my understanding.
    - When they are mature enough, I can just simply publish it as a by-product of my understanding.
