- When I thought about how I could learn from the [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>), I wonder how could I integrate it with the [bottom-up approach that I'm doing right now seamlessly. It requires a merge on my thinking to find a way to do both of them without the need of [[separation](<bottom-up approach that I'm doing right now seamlessly.

I noticed that when I'm approaching things to train others, I like to work from a [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>) as this helps me to ensure that the value and the understanding are there for them. However, this also put pressure too much on my shoulder. Ideally, I want to have some small top-down ideas [breakdown](<breakdown.md>) that I want to develop and work to complete these fragments and train them as well. This is exactly how [progressive development approach](<progressive development approach.md>)
