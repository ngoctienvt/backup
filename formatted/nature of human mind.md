    - Stored information as a node in a network system with an interrelated relationship with other nodes.

    - Connecting instead of categorizing. Categorizing is to help the mind able to [extract and gather information](<extract and gather information.md>) easier, but it's not the real power of the mind. The power of it is on the ability to generate new things from old things. [generative wisdom](<generative wisdom.md>) [condensing process](<condensing process.md>) - **generative is the nature of the mind.**
    - The mind is not a good [information storehouse](<information storehouse.md>), because it will only remember what it's interested in and the [general impression](<general impression.md>) but not the detail. Because we have a [limited source of energy](<limited source of energy.md>), so our mind will unconsciously remove or change the information in a way that it is related to other central nodes that already in there. 
        - The mind is not a good [[information storehouse].
        - The mind is not [energy-efficiency](<energy-efficiency.md>) to withdraw and maintain information in our mind.
    - We - the [witness consciousness](<witness consciousness.md>) - is the person who can direct the mind to generate wisdom by putting our energy into the [condensing process](<condensing process.md>). The main way is by using questions to provoke the mind to think in that direction. [powerful questions](<powerful questions.md>).
    - We can also give it materials by input experiences, reading books, experimenting,... This is [input process](<input process.md>) so the mind can have materials to continue it [condensing process](<condensing process.md>).
