- I noticed that when I'm thinking about writing an article, my mind filled with the need to supplement that with other related explanations so that the audience can dig deeper and learn from a single source of truth. It will not be able to build one time, but just like my PKD, I can build them up slowly and this is probably my best wish for creating the blog.
