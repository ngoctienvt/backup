- I noticed that my workflow, task & project management, and weekly/daily planning will be tightly related to each other. [The Pilot MOC](<The Pilot MOC.md>)
    - My [ðŸŒ²Workflow ](<ðŸŒ²Workflow .md>) will let me know what type of task that I want to work on
        - Types of tasks
            - Consuming
            - Processing
            - Unifying
            - Releasing...
            - Thinking...
    - Task & project management will store list of tasks and projects that I want to focus on.
        - Weekly planning I will plan about projects and schedule activities
            - [project management](<project management.md>) Area of focus or projects will have different stages to work on
                - [Learning phase](<Learning phase.md>)
                - [Developing phase](<Developing phase.md>)
                - [Creating phase](<Creating phase.md>)
        - Daily planning I will plan about the specific tasks that I want to focus on that day
- [horizons of spiritual growth](<horizons of spiritual growth.md>)
    - no-self - universal consiousness
    - serving and raising the unfolding reality
    - handle high-hanging fruits
    - handle low-hanging fruits (weather, past experiences, limiting beliefs...)
    - nurture presence or centering on the seat of awareness
    - nurture desire and willingness to free yourself and live a surrender life 
- I felt that I'm starting to release more and more my attachments due to the awareness that everything has its own level of development. I can't let my own samskaras to put my standards and expectations to other people. They are what I need to let go, not what I need to reinforce on. [samskaras](<samskaras.md>)
-  I noticed that's when offer [@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh](<@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh.md>) to buy for me a book, there is a need inside of me that doesn't want to waste and use it effectively, while I also want to somehow have it influence her in a good way somehow indirectly. It's my big lesson to let go my [need for efficient](<need for efficient.md>) first, then it's simply a way for me to support her indirectly.
-  I learned that it's better to do all the [admin tasks](<admin tasks.md>) first, so that I can just focus on the important things, instead of multi-tasking, because I need to not just simply hear the information, but also let it fully go in and digest the information and the experiences.
