    - Highlights:
        - It has been an interesting week that I manage to improve my capacity to play games without feeling burning out.
        - I also notice that my mind has a tendency to become active when I'm thinking or caring about certain things. I'm learning to quiet it down and adjust my presence into the now moment.
        - I also notice that as long as I take care good at myself, I will have things leftover to take care for other people. It's appear to be selfish in the first place, but as long as I'm working on the right and suitable approach, I will able to expand the capacity to serve others while being true to myself at the same time.
            - It's about a life of harmony instead of a life of struggle, sacrifice or selfish.
        - My inner flow of energy still purify day by day and I will learn to be patience with the process, because there is no need for rushing things out. The universe is running by itself, and I'm just a part of it. What I need is offer myself into it, rather than busy worrying about how it should take place.
            - It's all about faith and surrender.
        - For coaching and spirituality, I start to see how these two things come into each other.
            -  Coaching is more about working with realization and reframe the mind. In the process of self-realization, the person will be able to detach with who they think they are and work at the root over time based on these realization and reframing. 
            - While spirituality is more about working directly with the heart, the samskaras, the blockages and detachment with the mind and the heart.
