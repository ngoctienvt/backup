- I feel hard to design the next group coaching session, as I'm not able to clearly see what would be the measure of success for the session
    - The measure success for the session is about participants can know how to bring up their inner strength to face any challenges and develop skillset to walk through the challenges.
        - In order to bring up participants inner strength, I'm not sure how to be able to do that, but somehow it could be relate to coaching.
            - A person will be able to call up their inner strength when
                - They have the necessary support to face the challenge
                - They walk through the similar situation few times
                - They have enough skills that make them feel trust about their ability to face the challenges
                - They know how to move forward and focus on the process, and let things unfold rather than focus too much on the outcomes or what they don't know - it's important to clarify what they are aiming to and see how these obstacles get in the way - CONTEXT 
                - There are something important for them and call up the goodness inside of them. Or what's costing them is too much that they don't want to trade of.
        - For the skillset to walk through the challenges
            - They need to have some fundamental knowledges and principles about how life works
                - Life is unfolding and we can't sure about everything - but we can always see what next step would help us to get closer to our goals
                    - We need to develop the habit to walk one step at a time and identify the next step continously, rather than setting everything out and get upset when things get in the way.
                - Growth is important, because as long as we grow, things will become easier overtime.
                - Challenges are there to expose the gap of competency, so that we will know what we need to improve next
                - What important is not what you achieve but rather how you have transform along the way
                - There will be seduction to take the shortcut that will help us skip through the growth process
    - I wonder what if I don’t have the intention to teach anything, but only helping others to realize and learn by themselves. They will develop their own way, their own skills, and walk their own path. Of course there will be some knowledge needed about the reality, but for the inner skills, I foundout that it would helpful to help them move forward their own journey, develop their own way of thinking and working.
        - As for me, Bloom is a little bit unsuitable for group coaching. In group coaching, it’s better to focus on the person and facilitate their transformation to equip what needed. Recognize - reflect - emerge - shift - loop. Somehow the process will like this.
- I feel that I'm easy to feel pressure when I'm doing anything, because I have a strong attachment that the result need to be as good as possible. I want to let this need go, and embrace the new way of being that letting myself to be do the best, but not attach to the outcome and let the result be the teacher for me instead. 
    - There will be no best way, but only lessons that will help me to grow and do better over time.
    - I will learn to enjoy the process, no matter the outcome, and be fully unattach, and receiving instead.
