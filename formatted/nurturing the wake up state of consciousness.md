- [consciousness](<consciousness.md>) seems to have two states
    - One is [wake up state](<wake up state.md>). This is a stage that I can aware about myself. I can aware what I am aware.
    - Second is [asleep state](<asleep state.md>). This is a stage that I am no longer consciously know what I am aware and just let myself drown into it unconsciously.
- In order to nurture the [wake up state](<wake up state.md>), we need to know what makes us remain wake up first
    - One is [willpower](<willpower.md>). It's the will hep us to remain aware what we are aware.
    - Two is [energy](<energy.md>). Basically willpower is also type of energy, and that energy will be use for somethings to deplete it. 
- What drains our willpower?
    - The unconscious involving behaviors for resistance and clinging to hold the samskaras inside
    - The energy for physical activities
    - The energy for using our [intellectual mind](<intellectual mind.md>)
    - The energy for keeping our awareness directing our intention to our desire direction. Just like direct the ship to not controlled by the wind.
- There is few important tasks here
    - Nurturing the ability to detach so we can do our inner work 
    - Removing what drains our energy in an ineffective way
    - Recharging our consciousness effectively
- What activities could help us to nurture?
    - Relax and release samskaras
    - Externalizing the unnecessary tasks for our [intellectual mind](<intellectual mind.md>)
    - [energy management](<energy management.md>) properly, especially sleep and eating
    - Using our consciousness intentionally instead of scattering to multi tasks

## [October 7th, 2020](<October 7th, 2020.md>)
- I fall asleep after this [Morning Rituals MOC](<Morning Rituals MOC.md>), I am not able to keep myself awake and get used to the wake up stage. I want to work on this more to keep my consciousness awake on a longer period of times. It would relate to [energy management](<energy management.md>) and nurture my consciousness [willpower](<willpower.md>) to remain the ability to conscious more. This would be more about [spiritual energy](<spiritual energy.md>) and a part of [physical energy](<physical energy.md>).

- This afternoon I start to practice [nurturing the wake up state of consciousness](<nurturing the wake up state of consciousness.md>)
