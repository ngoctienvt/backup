## [November 6th, 2020](<November 6th, 2020.md>)
- I tend to try to the final step that is generalizing too much, and this makes me include all of the above stages that makes me feel overwhelming, while there is actually different stage to focus on. The reason is I'm not developing the ability to [breakdown](<breakdown.md>)

## [October 4th, 2020](<October 4th, 2020.md>)
I noticed that when I'm approaching things to train others, I like to work from a [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>) as this helps me to ensure that the value and the understanding are there for them. However, this also put pressure too much on my shoulder. Ideally, I want to have some small top-down ideas [breakdown](<breakdown.md>)

## [clean up fleeting notes](<clean up fleeting notes.md>)
- try to link the ideas in a specific way instead of broad categories. Or if there is a broad category, then work top-down to [breakdown](<breakdown.md>)

## [contextual linking](<contextual linking.md>)
- the topics that includes the smaller topics, so that when I'm accumulated the information enough, I could see the pattern of them to use [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>) to breakdown things [breakdown](<breakdown.md>)

## [journaling training](<journaling training.md>)
- Breakdown the big concepts onto smaller concepts [breakdown](<breakdown.md>)
