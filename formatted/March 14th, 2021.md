- In today coaching session with anh Kh√°nh, what I gained are [üìùMy Coaching Review](<üìùMy Coaching Review.md>)
    - I realized that there will be a shift that need to occur in my state of being about life
        - The new stage of being is a state that focus on keeping the inner energy and the outer world flow without any stuck
            - I will need to develop a willingness to embrace life no matter what, and not left behind anything but use every single life experiences as a materials for my own growth
            - I will also need to develop the courage to surrender myself, to let myself die completely so that I could fulfill my dharma duties
    -  I realized that the reason why things still got stuck is because I have a tendency to understand clearly the process before letting them happens
        - This is a big gift for me so that I can slowly but surely have a sustainable growth and development, and fulfill my job as the same time.
        - The drawback is the growth is slow and not fully occur, it's kind of a reserved-attitude
        - Anyway I still feel good about this and appreciate this gift and I will develop it further in the future
    - I realized that there will be different skills and abilities that need to develop in different stages of growth [The inner path](<The inner path.md>)
        - From the 3rd to 4th chakra, what's important here is the ability to see the truth, the willingness to live the truth, and the capacity to embrace the truth
            - It's also important to learn from the truth fully and transform it without any judgement.
            - It's important to know what's the trap so that we could get out of the trap and do what it means to be to come to the next stage
            - The outcome of this stage is the development of the capacity to center, embrace, and some wisdom about life
        - In the 4th chakra, there will be some important to have the ability to contain the transformational energy, being in the stage of letting things happen fully and purely without any personal preferences.
        - From the 4th chakra to the next level, it's the transition from being to expressing stage. 
            - In this stage, it's about learning to see what's requiring us to fulfill, what are our duties now, what the moment need from us now.
            - It's important to have the ability 
                - to see clearly the duties, 
                - and to fulfill the duties without any personal preferences.
                    - to have the courage to fulfill the duties, 
                    - to use the experiences as growth materials for the soul 
                    - to let go all of beliefs, preconceived notions, learned knowledge and transform them into pure wisdom/ pure insights
            - These are 2 main skills that will be develop in this stage.
            - There will also have a big transition from the way of working
                - From generalization (thinking) to seeing the indiduality (being/ presence)
                - From personal preferences to expressing and completing what's meant to be
    - One important thing is the more I move up the center, the less I think for myself, and the more I pay attention for THE WHOLENESS. I will less act for myself, and will act more for THE WHOLENESS. It's true surrendering.
        - I will have less the "me" - the "Ng·ªçc Ti·∫øn", and rather just be a witness consciousness - a being that exist in this body, and blur out the personal identification.
    - What I will focus next is learn to create a new integration path of the inner world and the outer world by using the next training course as a practice.
- [üìùWeekly Review](<üìùWeekly Review.md>)
    - This week has been a week about new emergence stage. It's about continuing to let go, while accomodating to the being stage, and wondering about the expressing stage.
        - What I gained so far this week are a bigger picture point-of-view about the inner journey. [üå±The life path](<üå±The life path.md>)
            - The lower energy are necessary for the growth of the soul.
            - The heart chakra is where the low energy transform into a higher energy and form into certain qualities that beyond comprehension of the mind.
            - The express stage or higher chakra is about learning how to express and use the high energy to serve the reality back.
            - The soul is gone through a journey to become more awaken and more conscious, more focus and less being distracted, more wisdom and less learned knowledge, more expanded and less contracted.
    - True love is not about finding it, it will happen when it happens. I won't love in a personal way, I will have the pure love inside myself, and then share this love to raise the people around me together. My center will be on me, and not being run around by my lower energy. [true love](<true love.md>)
        - I trust that each person have their own destiny, and their is no right or wrong in the end. We will grow through pain, struggle, confusion, separation, but true growth only happens when we go through them. 
    - Family has been an important part for me, I haven't able to connect with my family yet, but I will keep clearing what hold me back of them. I will watch B·ªë gi√† next week, so that I could clean these things inside me more. 
    - Today, I noticed that I still have a strong judgement about people who judge other people based on their feelings and perceptions. This is a big lesson for me as it's easy to do the right thing when my feelings are neutral, it's harder when we are being distorted by the color of the feelings.
    - The biggest uniqueness about me is the ability to clarify the process. I will not care much about the result, but about how things happen. By understanding this, I can support other people easier and create a proper way of approach. [üå±My Uniqueness](<üå±My Uniqueness.md>)
    - Next week
        - I will focus on clarifying the training course to use it as a practice for the new emergence way of working.
        - I will continue reading Tantra - The supreme understanding to have more clarity about [üå±The life path](<üå±The life path.md>)
        - I will continue working on my judgement, fear, and transform them to new way of living.
        - I will go watch B·ªë gi√†
        - Embrace everything that I got from today coaching
    - I noticed that I still have the strong feeling toward [@Nguy·ªÖn M·ªπ Linh](<@Nguy·ªÖn M·ªπ Linh.md>). I will learn to fully accept and transform these feelings, so that the quality of true love is formed.
