- In today coaching session with anh Kh√°nh, what I gained are [üìùMy Coaching Review](<üìùMy Coaching Review.md>)
    - I realized that there will be a shift that need to occur in my state of being about life
        - The new stage of being is a state that focus on keeping the inner energy and the outer world flow without any stuck
            - I will need to develop a willingness to embrace life no matter what, and not left behind anything but use every single life experiences as a materials for my own growth
            - I will also need to develop the courage to surrender myself, to let myself die completely so that I could fulfill my dharma duties
    -  I realized that the reason why things still got stuck is because I have a tendency to understand clearly the process before letting them happens
        - This is a big gift for me so that I can slowly but surely have a sustainable growth and development, and fulfill my job as the same time.
        - The drawback is the growth is slow and not fully occur, it's kind of a reserved-attitude
        - Anyway I still feel good about this and appreciate this gift and I will develop it further in the future
    - I realized that there will be different skills and abilities that need to develop in different stages of growth
        - From the 3rd to 4th chakra, what's important here is the ability to see the truth, the willingness to live the truth, and the capacity to embrace the truth
            - It's also important to learn from the truth fully and transform it without any judgement.
            - It's important to know what's the trap so that we could get out of the trap and do what it means to be to come to the next stage
            - The outcome of this stage is the development of the capacity to center, embrace, and some wisdom about life
        - In the 4th chakra, there will be some important to have the ability to contain the transformational energy, being in the stage of letting things happen fully and purely without any personal preferences.
        - From the 4th chakra to the next level, it's the transition from being to expressing stage. 
            - In this stage, it's about learning to see what's requiring us to fulfill, what are our duties now, what the moment need from us now.
            - It's important to have the ability 
                - to see clearly the duties, 
                - and to fulfill the duties without any personal preferences.
                    - to have the courage to fulfill the duties, 
                    - to use the experiences as growth materials for the soul 
                    - to let go all of beliefs, preconceived notions, learned knowledge and transform them into pure wisdom/ pure insights
            - These are 2 main skills that will be develop in this stage.
            - There will also have a big transition from the way of working
                - From generalization (thinking) to seeing the indiduality (being/ presence)
                - From personal preferences to expressing and completing what's meant to be
    - One important thing is the more I move up the center, the less I think for myself, and the more I pay attention for THE WHOLENESS. I will less act for myself, and will act more for THE WHOLENESS. It's true surrendering.
        - I will have less the "me" - the "Ng·ªçc Ti·∫øn", and rather just be a witness consciousness - a being that exist in this body, and blur out the personal identification.
    - What I will focus next is learn to create a new integration path of the inner world and the outer world by using the next training course as a practice.
