## [September 23rd, 2020](<September 23rd, 2020.md>)
- When watching The first song program, I realized I still haven't able to handle my feelings with Ki·ªÅu. I still feel a lot of regret and miss. It's a [memorable memories](<memorable memories.md>) for me that I still attach so much to how fun, how happy that I was. I realized that my love life still has a lot of [samskaras](<samskaras.md>) that I haven't finished to merge, to fully experience, and to let go yet. I want to contain all of these memorable memories so that I can fully enjoy the presence and maybe these are the things that I can payback for them, for other people or my future lover. [love](<love.md>)

- I feel so grateful for all of the people that used to love me, which taught me a lot of things and that got hurt by me. I wish they have the best life and the best [love](<love.md>)
