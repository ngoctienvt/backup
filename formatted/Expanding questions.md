- "I will work on to have my own synthesis and condensing process first. It will need to solve few big [Expanding questions](<Expanding questions.md>)"
    - "How I can create a head page or evergreen head pages for condensing internal and external materials in an bottom-up approach? "
        - **[Free-thoughts](<Free-thoughts.md>):** My concern now is about how I will manage the information and the development of different concepts/ ideas or understanding in a way that it's not too separation.
            - For example, if I have a bottom-up evolution concept, then I will have a progressive approach that cover the bottom-up evolution concept. And I want to keep them relate but separate at the same time? How will I solve this?
                - In the bottom-up evolution concept, I will work on everything related directly to this and develop my understand it over time.
                - While in the progressive approach, the bottom-up evolution concept is just an application to this approach, not about fully understand the concept separately.
            - And what if my progressive approach could become a isolated concept itself and an application for other things
                - So my mind here now is concept will be isolated by itself, but related to other concept
                - While application will require the interaction and contextual usages of them. Like I can make a journaling training, and the application of the program will need to have the progressive approach concept, so that instead of building the program on progressive approach, I build them on my journaling training project page instead.
        - **[Expanding answers](<Expanding answers.md>):**
            - Concept will be isolated by itself, or could be live in a bigger concept to make it wholer, but understanding will be central around the idea of the topic concept.
            - Application or project will withdraw the concept to server proper contextual usages, so that the intention will be achieve.
    - "How will I handle the cluster of information so that I won't waste time to review the materials that I'm completely absorb?"
        - "Delete? Or query? Or filter? "
    - "How I will organize my way of tagging and creating page?"
        - **[Free-thoughts](<Free-thoughts.md>):** It's not clear for me yet. I think that free thoughts will not need tag, while the key summary, expanding answers, whatever that got condensed will need to have tag instead. So that's I don't waste time to re-read unprocessed thoughts. 
            - However, will there be  a different level of processed thoughts is another [Expanding questions](<Expanding questions.md>)? And how will I organize this?
