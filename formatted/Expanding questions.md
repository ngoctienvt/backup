            - Internal and external data will be tag freely to process and clean up later.
                - Data on daily inbox will be clean by deleting.
                - Data on external sources will be clean up as well, but could store in a way that if I need to use in other context later.
            - If certain data is too big or not ready to process yet, leave it there.
            - Tag need to have general tags, and the main idea of that for resolve easier later.
    - "How I will organize my way of tagging and creating page?"
        - **[Free-thoughts](<Free-thoughts.md>):** It's not clear for me yet. I think that free thoughts will not need tag, while the key summary, expanding answers, whatever that got condensed will need to have tag instead. So that's I don't waste time to re-read unprocessed thoughts.
