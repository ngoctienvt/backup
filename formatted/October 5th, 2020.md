- This morning I felt too tired because of all activities that I made last night. I slept late, masturbated, played games. These all activities drained my physical body too much that I lost in the dream and my will power is too weak to wake up. [energy management](<energy management.md>)
- [x] I will work about my [energy management](<energy management.md>) this week
- When I'm reading Light Novels, it's really struck me hard that the feeling of unfairness, the feeling of life too hard is still there with me. There is still a part inside of me that wants things to be easier and wants to trust something that happens for a good reason.  [trust the process](<trust the process.md>) [unfairness](<unfairness.md>)

What if there is no good reason? What if there is nothing to count on except me? Am I give up or am I taking all responsibilities for my own life? Am I do the best at I can or am I count on external things? [independent](<independent.md>) [willpower](<willpower.md>) [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>) [impersonal responsibilities](<impersonal responsibilities.md>)

This is really a big [life lessons](<life lessons.md>) for me about releasing all the dependent thoughts instead of fully count on myself and trust myself. The self that can't speak. No thoughts are more me than me. Trust the one that aware, not the thoughts that it aware. 
- This week focus:
    - [x] [energy management](<energy management.md>)
    - [x] condensing knowledge about deep coaching
    - [ ] templates or thinking process 
-  I feel that I am still not so much clear how the [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>) really apply in the context of [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>). I still feel that I think more about the system and how the [workflow](<workflow.md>) need to go in a smooth way. I want to focus on [workflow](<workflow.md>) in a general concept and in a practical way as well.
- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) I felt that my coaching started to lengthy and unclear focus. It felt broad and lengthy instead of clear, concise and deepen.
- I still feel confused and stuck when trying to understand the way that I can use Roam Research to organize my information in a natural way. I still concern when to put information on the nodes, when simply just let them out on page.

I feel that I start to put unnecessary pressure on me to top-down things instead of letting the bottom-up build up itself. [need for big pictures](<need for big pictures.md>) [personal needs](<personal needs.md>). I need to see Roam Research fully how to build from [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>) more than [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>).
- Instead of thing how to organize Roam Research, it would be better if I find out how I can let the process build itself like how the life works. [self-evolving process](<self-evolving process.md>)
