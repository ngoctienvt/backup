- I noticed that I start to learn how to merge the things I see together. Like people and context is not exclusive from the big picture, they are a part of big picture and what gives meaning to the picture. [inclusion](<inclusion.md>)
    - It's mean that even though I'm seeking for the big picture, I must see where the detail fit in instead of exclude them. It's learning to include rather than exclude. This requires not just understanding, but actually merging and transforming.
- I also learned that my [training method](<training method.md>) need to help people level up their knowledge map gradually. 
    - For instance, I could let them draw mind map for what they learn
    - Then slowly add more detail to the map, or merge the map with a bigger concept.
    - This will also a big role for me to handle my learning process

    - This thing can be something visible like people if suitable, but gradually will need to expand and grow into something much more conceptual, soul-based, truth-based.

        - It's important to check whether the agreement is what important for the clients - alignment between what they think is important and their feelings
- [types of information](<types of information.md>)
    - [concepts](<concepts.md>) is something that in order to understand it, you have to understand children of it, and different with [facts](<facts.md>) is you need to learn to understand, not simply remember or know is enough.
        - Depend on the context - simply know is facts, need to understand is concept
    - [procedures](<procedures.md>) we need to involve to do
    - [process](<process.md>) explain how something happens and we don't involve
    - [principles](<principles.md>) is something we need to do certain things in a better effective way
    - process helps to understand -> principles and procedures to apply
