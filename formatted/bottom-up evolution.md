- Definition: [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>) is an approach that 
    - focuses on now with [integration activtity](<integration activtity.md>) what haven't resolved and accumulate what's necessary for future-self 
    - let life unfolds and trust the process instead of trying to meet the demand of samskaras
- [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>) is a core components of [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>). I think that the word approach is not show the different between them.
    - While progressive approach is better to have the name approach.
    - bottom-up is a way, a mean or method, a component of progressive approach.

- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) I noticed that when coaching, I'm going a counter-intuitive approach. I put my way of coaching mainly on [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) instead of [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>),

- Start from the top is mostly about expectations and clinging.

- [living in the present](<living in the present.md>) I have a sensation about building up this thing is like I connect with all of the earth that below me (past experiences, my accumulated self, my past journey...) that are integrated and easy to relate with. Then I will just continue to build up myself from that based on [demand of reality](<demand of reality.md>) instead of worrying about where I need to go to.

- I noticed my need for [convenient](<convenient.md>) when I'm considering between Roam Research and Logseq, when trying to find the best slack even though I don't really know what I really need. The tendency to find things for convenient makes me operate wrongly from a [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) instead of start with [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>).

- Instead of trying to solve [convenient](<convenient.md>)samskaras with decision-making, it is a good chance for me to handle it and also to learn to practice [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>)

I feel that I start to put unnecessary pressure on me to top-down things instead of letting the bottom-up build up itself.

- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) I felt that if my [inner container](<inner container.md>) of energy got depleted, I can't coaching in an [optimal conditions](<optimal conditions.md>), which leads to the coaching is hard to become [transformation](<transformation.md>).

I also realize that my coaching tends to be mixing between [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>) and [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>), but it seems like the top-down approach is heavier, while coaching will tend to be more flexible and heavily on [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>).
