- I feel that I enjoy the process of writing or building the product [building process](<building process.md>), but I didn't enjoy the process of cleaning, refining, and polishing it. I feel completed when I completed to say everything I want, but it's not the end. [self-fulfilled](<self-fulfilled.md>) This is only for myself fulfillment, and it didn't count other people into it.

- I also realized that when fixing things, I only focus to do in a [react manner](<react manner.md>), instead of carefully reflect what needs to change or edit, and find the effective way to fix all of them. [refining and delivering process](<refining and delivering process.md>)
