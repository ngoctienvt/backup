    - Highlights
        - I noticed that there are many things that I still need to clean and let go, so that I can free my spiritual heart and embrace the divinity inside myself.
        - I started to see more clearly about the subjective truth of the world and the personal perceptions based on my feelings and my mind. 
            - I started to have a clear understanding to define what's true and what's not true but distort by feelings and my mind.
        - I start to develop a courage to say the truth about myself to another. 
        - I start to embrace the sexual desires fully, differentiate between what's happened inside and what's happened outside, so that I can learn to transform what's inside and establish a much stable center of awareness.
        - I start to release my judgements about other people when they are behave in unawaken state, and learn to embrace their unawaken actions and intentions. 
        - I start to embrace my parents in my whole being as we are one. Their sufferings are my sufferings. I feel grateful for what they distribute to me, nurture me, and raise me up. 
        - I start to have a clearer picture and understanding about true love.
