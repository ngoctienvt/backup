- [üìùWeekly Review](<üìùWeekly Review.md>)
    - Highlights:
        - The energy inside of me is becoming more and more, and so much that I feel hard to even focus, and remain comfortable. I will need to learn to adapt to this enormous energy. It's a prove that the direction I'm going is right.
        - I start to realize that whatever I'm trying based on my need, it's just may work on the short-term, but not work for the long-term. For instance, as I'm seeking relationship, it's never work and I never feel fully satisfy, okay with it. I will learn to not seek relationship but rather let it happens naturally instead.
        - I realize that I'm becoming more and more conscious of the waves of life and how it's happened in my life. And I start to learn how to ride these waves in a harmony way so that living become a blessing.
        - I notice that I start to be able to link the service path that I'm walking and expressing with much better clarity.
            - It's about how coaching, spirituality, training, group coaching, all of the methods could weave into each other.
            - And especially is HOW I will serve. The focus start change into HOW - attitude - the way of serving rather than focus too much on WHAT.
        - I start to learn to go beyond the physical planes and expand into infinite. Sometimes it feels hard because there is still something that block this expansion. I will learn more to be able to fully expand.
