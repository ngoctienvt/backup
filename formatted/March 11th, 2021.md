- What I learned so far about coaching after reviewing the session that anh Kh√°nh coach is [coaching mastery](<coaching mastery.md>)
    - Stories helped coach to understand more about the client's underlying concern (feelings, concern, state of being,...). There will be some background learning about client's way of thinking, belief system, perceptions, point of views...
    - The role of a coach is not about helping them to solve their stories, but it's about help clients to shift their center of focus from the stories to themselves. 
        - Help them see what they need, what they want is actually help them to have what? 
            - For my case, the need for knowing my role, my tasks will help me to become more active. It's solved the passive-ness that I don't want to stay on that stage. 
            - For anh Duy, the need to have some rules to teach children will help him to solve his insecurities about his roles as a parent.
- I noticed that I am walking the next stage, the stage of merging the inner path and the outer live. It's about learning how to have proper interaction with life. Live it to the fullest. Have an anchor to act as a compass for my life path, so that I will move forward rather than comeback to the personal self. 
    - My course will also help people to experience the transformation, so that they can see the path, walk the path, and manage to nurture the courage to continue walk forward. 
        - The path will not be easy, but it's simple and it's worth to pursue.
        - This path is not the path that everyone walk, it's the true path of life.
        - The special of my course is me. It's about my way of thinking, my intention, my purpose, my uniqueness, and my own experiences. This means that I don't have to compare myself to anyone, everyone will have their own place on the earth, so I don't need to de-evaluate myself.
