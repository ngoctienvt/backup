- What I learned so far about coaching after reviewing the session that anh Kh√°nh coach is
    - Stories helped coach to understand more about the client's underlying concern (feelings, concern, state of being,...). There will be some background learning about client's way of thinking, belief system, perceptions, point of views...
    - The role of a coach is not about helping them to solve their stories, but it's about help clients to shift their center of focus from the stories to themselves. 
        - Help them see what they need, what they want is actually help them to have what? 
            - For my case, the need for knowing my role, my tasks will help me to become more active. It's solved the passive-ness that I don't want to stay on that stage. 
            - For anh Duy, the need to have some rules to teach children will help him to solve his insecurities about his roles as a parent.
