- [conscious choice](<conscious choice.md>) is really not necessary. It's necessary now because I have many [samskaras](<samskaras.md>) that diverge myself in different directions.

My brain will start to tell me that it’s my limitation, that I should take a rest, that it’s okay to stop here. The whole point is I’m easy to be deceived by this thoughts that based on my past experiences, instead of I’m the one who check whether I want to stop or not, so that I could make my [conscious choice](<conscious choice.md>).

- I felt pretty [numb](<numb.md>) when I stop relax and feel but focus on things instead. It's like freezing myself so that's nothing can come in.

These [inner conflict](<inner conflict.md>) usually because of the [fear](<fear.md>) of not sure about the results of my action. For example, if I congratz someone, I still feel that if I'm helping or harming that person. [results](<results.md>) [conscious choice](<conscious choice.md>).
