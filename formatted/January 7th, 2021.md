- My today focus
    - Learning Super Brain
    - Work with [@D∆∞∆°ng Th·ªã Huy·ªÅn](<@D∆∞∆°ng Th·ªã Huy·ªÅn.md>) to develop more the PKDS system
    - Take time to handle the new experiences from my teeth
    - Start to work on my own [üå±Life Navigation Map](<üå±Life Navigation Map.md>)
- I noticed that my training course about [üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth](<üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth.md>) will base on
    - [üå±Life Navigation Map](<üå±Life Navigation Map.md>)
    - Each components of the map will have different principles and techniques to focus on
    - The whole map will have a system or process to handle the change and what emerge
    - In the Action Board, this is the most complicated with many things going on
- [Daily Worthy Stories](<Daily Worthy Stories.md>) Huy·ªÅn. Park. Casual Walk. Pancake. Wonder if I should call her or not?
- I‚Äôm not wrong with everyone. I‚Äôm only wrong with myself, because I‚Äôm not taking fully responsibilities for my growth and my state of being [generative language](<generative language.md>)
- I noticed that there will be certain [intrinsic qualities](<intrinsic qualities.md>) that based of my soul evolution, and from these qualities, I developed human learned abilities like languages, imagination, critical thinking, coaching...
- My whole next life chapter is directing myself to the truth that I clarify, not based on my thoughts, because they are based on my inner state and this is varied and not reliable. [truth-oriented](<truth-oriented.md>)
    - Through this I will be able to fully thrive and live fully, and know how to let go what is untruth or fear-based, and unblock true love, compassion and true wisdom.
    - Truth is not depend on what changes, but rather based on what always true and non-context (situation, people, things, beliefs, knowledges...) dependent.
