- My today focus
    - Learning Super Brain
    - Work with [@Dương Thị Huyền](<@Dương Thị Huyền.md>) to develop more the PKDS system
    - Take time to handle the new experiences from my teeth
    - Start to work on my own [🌱Life Navigation Map](<🌱Life Navigation Map.md>)
- I noticed that my training course about [🌱Training Course - Effortless Growth](<🌱Training Course - Effortless Growth.md>) will base on
    - [🌱Life Navigation Map](<🌱Life Navigation Map.md>)
    - Each components of the map will have different principles and techniques to focus on
    - The whole map will have a system or process to handle the change and what emerge
    - In the Action Board, this is the most complicated with many things going on
