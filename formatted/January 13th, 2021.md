- In this new stage of life, I want to have a clear picture about [ðŸ§­Productivity System MOC](<ðŸ§­Productivity System MOC.md>)
    - what I need to develop, 
    - what's my current stage (my styles, strengths, tendencies),
    - what I'm not comfortable with but it's important to have
    - how I will focus on my attention and how I will develop myself - the learning journey
        - the focus will be on serving the world, not about me expressing my ego
    -  It's all about how I could let go my restlessness and my stressfulness or trying too much, so that I could just relax, do things slowly but still complete them in an effective way
        - I need to have a room that in that room, I can casually complete what I need to do without worry too much. 
        - There will be different stages of my growth, but whether what stages, I can always know what I need to focus on and have the clear how to complete it
    - It's all about how I will manage the gap - the reality and the intention, because how I manage the gap now is based on my tendencies and maximize it, but it's not truly how things work [gap management](<gap management.md>)
- My today focus
    - Clarify the above picture
    - Clarify my learning styles
    - Think how I will want to design the activity that center on students
        - My tendency is mostly about how I can think of, but it has no direction to navigate. Now it's my time to learn to use principles or boundaries to navigate my focus on.
- [Organization of knowledge](<Organization of knowledge.md>) should be a part of some end purposes, so that the knowledge is organized in a way that serve these purposes.
    - For instance, if my purpose is to coach effectively, then my coaching knowledge need to be organize in a way that I can access them in a systematic way somehow so that I could coach better in the coaching session
    - If my purpose is to write inspiring blog posts, then my notes need to be serve me to create these blog posts easily.
    - The end point of learning is to have some kind of structure or [framework](<framework.md>), so that when you receive certain inputs, youâ€™re able to produce certain outputs.
        - The right way to take notes, then depends on two factors: 
            - the output that you want to create
            - your ability to work on that structure during the first pass.

- I noticed that the way we use our words determine that something is evidently exist without notice that it maybe comes from our mind instead. [impersonal language](<impersonal language.md>)
    - Such of these words are failures, risks, problems, win, lose,... My next stage of life will need to rearrange my whole way of seeing the truth of the world rather than the madeup of my mind and the society.
