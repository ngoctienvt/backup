- [ðŸŒ±My Coaching Reflection](<ðŸŒ±My Coaching Reflection.md>) Today I felt that my way of coaching is better because my ability to observe the world is better. I can know what's important to listen, what's not. [ability to see what's important](<ability to see what's important.md>)

I also noticed that my coaching is heavily a learning process, instead of problem-solving or achieving goals process. It emphasizes on clear understanding.
- Today focus
    - Finishing edit video 7
    - Coaching reflection deeply in next few days
    - Planning to learn [Courses - Effortless Output with Roam](<Courses - Effortless Output with Roam.md>)
- I also noticed that I'm on a stage breaking my mind limit, so that it could not make me trust to the information that it drew from my past experiences. [limiting thoughts](<limiting thoughts.md>). I'm so naÃ¯ve to trust it based on its statically insignificant data. [Wisdom](<Wisdom.md>)

If I want to know something, I need to be the one who really check it and [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>), not listen to the [limiting thoughts](<limiting thoughts.md>) of my mind. [current working](<current working.md>)
- I also on a transition stage that replacing my old [habit-formed will](<habit-formed will.md>) to a new direction that is more helpful and supportive for my [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>). [current working](<current working.md>)
- I felt quite hot when meditation but actually I can felt that I become better over time when I'm keep relax and release. I also noticed that at least I want to learn to enjoy [ðŸŒ±Unshakable Centering](<ðŸŒ±Unshakable Centering.md>) over anything else. It's hard, it's challenging, and it requires me to use my own will power to keep myself detach with my mind and my emotions, but I can se that it's a highest thing that I can do for myself, and there is no cost, no time, no loss, just benefits, sustainable benefits. [sustainable development](<sustainable development.md>) [true satisfaction](<true satisfaction.md>)
- I felt that I hard to treat [@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh](<@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh.md>) as everyone else. I still felt have [worry](<worry.md>) for her so much that I don't want to see her in that situation again. And this is my own lesson that I need to handle, because she will have her own lesson to learn, and my job is stand back, live my life as best as possible so that I can support her when she needed.
