-  I noticed that's when offer [@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh](<@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh.md>) to buy for me a book, there is a need inside of me that doesn't want to waste and use it effectively, while I also want to somehow have it influence her in a good way somehow indirectly. It's my big lesson to let go my [need for efficient](<need for efficient.md>)
