- I noticed that I want to become [financial independent](<financial independent.md>) by transcending my [attachment with money](<attachment with money.md>) and the dependent thoughts that rely on other people or external things, instead of nurture my own growth. #[Area of Focus](<Area of Focus.md>)
    - [financial independent](<financial independent.md>) is not about how much money I can make, but it's about
        - my state of being that unattachment with money and can see it simply as a tool to navigate through life
        - my focus on personal growth, so that I could outgrowth the challenges and the duties that are given to me [outgrowth](<outgrowth.md>)
            - I will narrow my focus to few things so that I could resolve these accumulated samskaras and my life lessons first.
        - nurturing my independent consciousness instead of spending time to listen my mind [seat of awareness](<seat of awareness.md>)
- For how to manage [Creating phase](<Creating phase.md>), I'm not totally clear about my creation process, I feel that I need to clarify about my way of networked thinking, instead of thinking in hierarchy or outline first. This is very important concept to support me to keep things centralized but flexible at the same time.
    - The output is where I consolidate different [atomic notes](<atomic notes.md>) to serve a certain specific purpose.
    - The [atomic notes](<atomic notes.md>) is where I hold my thinking around certain concepts that not overlap too much with others, but live independently.

    - What we gain so far? What are levels of satisfaction?
    - What are key learnings?
        - About goals or how things unfold
    - What are success factors?
    - Expanded learning from these key success factors and key learnings
    - Any feedback for me to support better
    - How we will process next after this coaching package?
- I felt much freer and more comfortable when I'm act on general rule which link to a reality instead of specific subjects or case-sensitive. It makes me to act based on truth rather than my fear or my need that got triggered by a people or a circumstance.
