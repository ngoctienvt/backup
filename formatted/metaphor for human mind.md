- Our [mind](<mind.md>) is not just like an PC, but actually looks like a universe with the power to create any star at any moments, based on the old stars. [metaphor for human mind](<metaphor for human mind.md>)

    - The human mind looks like a universe with each star is a node that represents a concept or idea. The stars in the universe operate inter-related with each other but do not have a hierarchy structure.
    - The human mind can create a new star based on the materials of the current nodes through a connecting and generating process. The more the node is polished and connected (the big star), the deeper and broader our understanding of it is. 
    - Our universe mind needs the energy to develop its universe, and there are 3 main jobs that our brain spend its energy are:
        - Stored information (maintain the stars to not die off)
        - Recall information (extract information from the stars)
        - Generate new meanings or connections (create new advanced stars)
