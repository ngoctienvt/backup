- I also not used to disconnect external things, so I am easy to distract by them. And because I tend to distract by them, so it's hard for me to [resist the urge](<resist the urge.md>) to focus on them and focus on myself instead. Because they are much more [interesting](<interesting.md>) and easy to focus on instead of me. [distraction](<distraction.md>)
