- Level 1 - raw data collecting
    - This level is about collecting raw data and start to emerge "something" meaningful 
- Level 2 - building the forest
    - Notes start to direct link and form relationship to each other.
        - No higher-order notes
    - The system start to come alive, and naturally evolve itself.
    - The beauty of the direct link is that ideas emerge organically. The limitation is that you're always in the forest. 
    - Very often, you want a birds-eye view of these relationships. 
- Level 3 - bird-eye view - UNIFYING
    - Making higher-order notes— "notes with primary links to other notes". 
        - Higher-order notes like MOCs (Maps of Content) serve countless purposes...
        - You can use MOCs to overcome "Mental Squeeze Points" & continue triumphantly w/ your ideas & projects. Just "Assemble" links to notes in a new MOC. You offload the cognitive burden so you stay in creative Flow - ASSEMBLING
    - But the even more profound and next-level power of MOCs is to USE THEM AS RAPID IDEATION CHAMBERS. MOCs are IDEATION ACCELERATORS!  
    - Higher-order notes like MOCs can be used for navigational purposes (hence the "Map" nomenclature).
    - With your MOCs, you are 80% of the way done to finalized CREATION!
- Level 4 
    - MOCs are linked to MOCs! Instead of a just having living systems (basic Zettelkasten)...
    - Now we have living ecosystems!
- Level 5
    - Now, we get to the highest level of your Idea Emergence...Your HOME NOTE

It consolidates new higher-order notes w/ older, more mature higher-order notes.

The Home note is the beginning & the end. It is a launchpad & a homebase. It is your North Star.

    - At this level, your ideas have become like a relatively stable Planetary system. (someone else's PKM would be another planet btw).

It's your "Earth"

"All roads lead to HOME."
    - The Home note allows for top-down “Convergent” thinking like navigating and deliberate creating.

The Home note allows for bottom-up “Convergent” thinking by consolidating new forms of emergence.
