        - Purpose of session 1: 
            - get used to know each other
            - get used to tools - Jamboard and Zoom
            - doing activities to have a big picture about design workshop and survey student needs
        - How sesion flow
            - While You Wait activities
            - Getting used to Jamboard activities
                - Purpose
                    - Gain-attention activity to help ice-breaking [gain-attention](<gain-attention.md>)
                    - Interact to each other 
                    - Ensure everyone can use tools
                    - Help students learn to use different features of tools through activities
                        - For example
                            - Getting used to create sticky notes
                            - Getting used to interact with each other on a Jamboard page
                            - Getting used to workshop and keywords
            - Introduce yourself and get to know facilitators activities
                - This is an indirect activities to introduce facilitators. It reduces one-way interaction
                - Grouping to different people to have a narrow and deeper interaction to each other
            - What is the similarities between design a workshop and design a house?
                - Grouping
                - Request to gather to only 3 visible similarities
                    - It requires students to think in higher level (understand, compare, a bit of analytic and evaluate)
                - Metaphor question is to help guide students start to think about design a workshop - guided thinking
                    - If students are required to discuss steps to design a workshop, the gap of thinking will be too big.
                    - Start with level understand and compare first.
                - These activities are [guided thinking](<guided thinking.md>) activities to help students level up their thinking slowly
            - 5 steps to design a workshop activity
                - Group people to 4 groups, discuss and summarize 5 steps to design a workshop
                - [steps activities](<steps activities.md>)
                    - Request students to list specific number of steps to complete certain tasks based on students' own experience.
                - For content that have process and steps, this activity help to survey how everyone is doing.
                - Purpose
                    - Survey the level of students
                    - Bring out a standard process
                - Everyone will group what discussed to become 5 steps and introduce steps if neccessary.
                - Grouping again to discuss more details on each step
                    - Note:
                        - For big group, a limit number of step is helpful to focus 
                        - For small group, number of step could be flexible for creativity
                - These steps can be teach one-way very fast, but there will lack of interaction, and students will feel hard to understand and remember.
                    - By interacting and creating their own content, they will remember better.
                    - This is called "[generative-instructional strategy](<generative-instructional strategy.md>)" instead of [supplantive-instructional strategy](<supplantive-instructional strategy.md>)".
                        - [Flow model](<Flow model.md>)
                            - Balance between provide knowledge and guidance practices
                            - ![Csikszentmihalyi’s 3-channel flow model ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jon_Pearce/publication/251772214/figure/fig1/AS:298183650496516@1448103930761/Csikszentmihalyis-3-channel-flow-model.png)
            - Write down questions to dig deep activity
                - An activity to help students guide their learning process
                    - It's a need survey and evaluate right from the beginning.
                    - From these questions, facilitators can adjust program properly, and help students prime their mind to focus.
                - Number of questions are 5 and group into steps of design a wokshop
                    - This is a analytic thinking level
                - The way to link activities are 
                    - results of above activities are input or foundation the next activities.
            - What principles needed for a workshop activity
                - Listing and choosing activities
            - Introduce workshop activity
                - It's not necessary to introduce the program at the beginning.
                - It should be introduce when participants have some knowledge about the program.
            - Completing sentences acitivities
                - Completing 2 sentences in group chat
                    - Today I feel...
                    - In this program, I will focus on... to...
                - Purpose
                    - It helps participants to focus into what's matter and valuable
        - Overall note
            - A online workshop will require more interactions than offline workshop, because participants will be distract easier.
            - The process to survey needs will not only occur before, but inside the activities of workshop
                - This is call "hidden agenda" of that activity
            - Design a workshop should have some backup activities if there is enough time.
- Session 2 - Identify goal of a workshop
    - [https://jamboard.google.com/d/12MlhfRKAwpCZAxRca4JiJje67jyszd8JMttRJq16Df0/edit?usp=sharing](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjamboard.google.com%2Fd%2F12MlhfRKAwpCZAxRca4JiJje67jyszd8JMttRJq16Df0%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing%26fbclid%3DIwAR3aker-XNm0OWSSjfzuRdwzBTN0PqZ3Ov3t2qJpoBM_DLwMBDeO-7caPaU&h=AT06Jqi9PThd74YI75ZX8WvV0bLcvdYpME4dgQDsZ3WaWJxDCRGo8pRo5ZfqARAu_K_o_fB7EXf1Uub957f3iRqTbSMV01s6ht4sTqRmhxK7ASqmIoIp6xR08aCunQmL7gtNxQ)
    - Flow of session 2
- Session 3 - Tasks analysis

        - https://jamboard.google.com/d/1XR-dnZ1L_VqcMQgZR9f6Ch7isSpXQbcnK6zSLxRvASM/edit?usp=sharing
        - Tasks analysis is list down everything a person need to do to complete a major goal, in a reality scenario - not classom. 
            - The list down process will focus on the participant, not focus on what the trainer will teach.
        - "Boil egg" activities
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BV5EMnpXf7cVWR3gdm9NMgUIby1XNxMYOUoDjAVQULA/edit?usp=sharing
            - 6- Boil egg activities - demo activites
                - Use pictures to let participants choice, so that they will have a feeling of free-choice and will more engage.
                - Do together with everyone, and emphasizes what need to care when doing tasks analysis
                - This type of demo activities will bring people to situation, and have their own learning in different aspects of activities.
                    - Main lesson for tasks analysis
                        - Simple task in head because we did it doesn't mean it simple to describe details for another person who know nothing about it
                        - If the goal and the target participant is not clear, tasks analysis will be very complicated
        - [Opening activities](<Opening activities.md>)
            - Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM6B0k3E25I&ab_channel=ConnectionCoach
                - Benefits of video:
                    - Stimulate the emotions of participants, so it helps to lead to lessons
                    - Put participants into a specific situation, so it helps to lead to the situation that facilitator want students focus on.
                    - Deliver information by stories which help students to remember easier
                    - These benefits are not apply for "how-to" video, but for situation video.
                - "Share 2 outstanding emotions of two children"
                    - With activities have emotion involve, harvest emotions immediately will help students learn.
                        - For examples, an activity that require participants to choose 2 emotions from a list of emotions.
                - "What dad want to teach the children?"
                    - After havest emotions, this is a step to harvest the lesson in that situation of the video.
                    - If ask this question immediately after watch Video, participants can feel confuse, because their mind still focus on the video and the emotions emerge.
                - "How to apply the lesson to design a workshop?"
                    - After harvest lesson based on the situation of the activity, this step is about link to real life situation.
                - The step to harvest an emotional activities
                    - Do activities
                    - Harvest emotions
                    - Harvest lessons in the situation of the activities
                    - Expanded learning to real life situation

        - What should/ shouldn't do when doing tasks analysis
            - Harvest activities for "boil egg" activities
            - Help people grab the tasks analysis process and its principle
            - It requires people to analyze and evaluate what they just gone through.
        - Project-based learning 
            - People will execute a small project for them
            - The project in this case is a goal of workshop of 3 students
            - Facilitators also need to attend to the process
                - This is called "scaffolding" - helping process.
                    - Facilitator will support direct by involve and ask questions (high support level). 
                    - Then reduce over time and only involve when necessary. 
                    - At the end, the support will reduce to lowest so that students can complete by themselves.
        - Harvest after practices
            - This is important after demo, practice, or an activities that have "aha moments".
        - Summarize by "Square, Circle, Triangle" activities
            - Square - what you knew and are reinforced
            - Circle - What you still not clear (fast survey)
            - Triangle - Top 3 important lessons that you have for yourself
- Session 5 - Selecting contents to deliver

        - Design objectives (thiết kế nội dung) are listing knowledge or information that participant need to be able to complete the tasks.
            - Results are list of knowledge or information that need to teach.
        - Đánh giá 
            - tự phân tích đưa ra được đặc điểm của bản thân
            - kiểm chứng đặc điểm của người khác
        - Task là hoạt động cần làm. Objective là hiểu biết nội tại cần thiết để làm được hoạt động.
            - Task là outcome cần, objective là kiến thức để làm được outcome.
            - Task trước, outcome sau.
            - Reality đi trước, không phải personal needs
        - Những điều người học cần biết để làm được điều này là gì?
        - Kiến thức này sẽ giúp họ làm được điều gì?
