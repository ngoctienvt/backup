        - Purpose of session 1: 
            - get used to know each other
            - get used to tools - Jamboard and Zoom
            - doing activities to have a big picture about design workshop and survey student needs
        - How sesion flow
            - While You Wait activities
            - Getting used to Jamboard activities
                - Purpose
                    - Gain-attention activity to help ice-breaking [gain-attention](<gain-attention.md>)
                    - Interact to each other 
                    - Ensure everyone can use tools
                    - Help students learn to use different features of tools through activities
                        - For example
                            - Getting used to create sticky notes
                            - Getting used to interact with each other on a Jamboard page
                            - Getting used to workshop and keywords
            - Introduce yourself and get to know facilitators activities
                - This is an indirect activities to introduce facilitators. It reduces one-way interaction
                - Grouping to different people to have a narrow and deeper interaction to each other
            - What is the similarities between design a workshop and design a house?
                - Grouping
                - Request to gather to only 3 visible similarities
                    - It requires students to think in higher level (understand, compare, a bit of analytic and evaluate)
                - Metaphor question is to help guide students start to think about design a workshop - guided thinking
                    - If students are required to discuss steps to design a workshop, the gap of thinking will be too big.
                    - Start with level understand and compare first.
                - These activities are [guided thinking](<guided thinking.md>) activities to help students level up their thinking slowly
            - 5 steps to design a workshop activity
                - Group people to 4 groups, discuss and summarize 5 steps to design a workshop
                - [steps activities](<steps activities.md>)
                    - Request students to list specific number of steps to complete certain tasks based on students' own experience.
                - For content that have process and steps, this activity help to survey how everyone is doing.
                - Purpose
                    - Survey the level of students
                    - Bring out a standard process
                - Everyone will group what discussed to become 5 steps and introduce steps if neccessary.
                - Grouping again to discuss more details on each step
                    - Note:
                        - For big group, a limit number of step is helpful to focus 
                        - For small group, number of step could be flexible for creativity
                - These steps can be teach one-way very fast, but there will lack of interaction, and students will feel hard to understand and remember.
                    - By interacting and creating their own content, they will remember better.
                    - This is called "[generative-instructional strategy](<generative-instructional strategy.md>)" instead of [supplantive-instructional strategy](<supplantive-instructional strategy.md>)".
                        - [Flow model](<Flow model.md>)
                            - Balance between provide knowledge and guidance practices
                            - ![Csikszentmihalyi’s 3-channel flow model ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jon_Pearce/publication/251772214/figure/fig1/AS:298183650496516@1448103930761/Csikszentmihalyis-3-channel-flow-model.png)
            - Write down questions to dig deep activity
                - An activity to help students guide their learning process
                    - It's a need survey and evaluate right from the beginning.
                    - From these questions, facilitators can adjust program properly, and help students prime their mind to focus.
                - Number of questions are 5 and group into steps of design a wokshop
                    - This is a analytic thinking level
                - The way to link activities are 
                    - results of above activities are input or foundation the next activities.
            - What principles needed for a workshop activity
                - Listing and choosing activities
            - Introduce workshop activity
                - It's not necessary to introduce the program at the beginning.
                - It should be introduce when participants have some knowledge about the program.
            - Completing sentences acitivities
                - Completing 2 sentences in group chat
                    - Today I feel...
                    - In this program, I will focus on... to...
                - Purpose
                    - It helps participants to focus into what's matter and valuable
        - Overall note
            - A online workshop will require more interactions than offline workshop, because participants will be distract easier.
            - The process to survey needs will not only occur before, but inside the activities of workshop
                - This is call "hidden agenda" of that activity
            - Design a workshop should have some backup activities if there is enough time.
- Session 2 - Identify goal of a workshop

- Đây là mô tả chung về những thành phần của một quá trình thiết kế một workshop (và cũng có thể ứng dụng cho buổi đào tạo, bài giảng, hoặc một chương trình giáo dục đào tạo có mục tiêu cụ thể khác).

Analysis of Target Group: Phân tích nhóm đối tượng tiềm năng của workshop. Kết quả của phần này là mô tả một “nhân vật điển hình” để nắm rõ hình ảnh về đối tượng của workshop là ai. Phần này sẽ được thực hiện ngay trong Buổi 2.

Needs Analysis: Phân tích nhu cầu của nhóm đối tượng. Kết quả của phần này là những nhu cầu mà workshop cần đảm bảo, những vấn đề mà workshop cần giải quyết, hoặc những sự thay đổi mà workshop cần tạo ra cho người tham gia. Phần này cũng sẽ được thực hiện trong Buổi 2. Sau đó, mục tiêu lớn của workshop sẽ được xác định rõ.

Task Analysis: Phân tích nhiệm vụ mà người tham gia cần hoàn thành. Kết quả của phần này là bảng mô tả những gì người tham gia cần làm được để đạt được mục tiêu lớn nói trên. Phần này sẽ được thực hiện trong Buổi 3.

Definition of Objectives: Xác định những mục tiêu cụ thể của workshop. Kết quả của phần này là cấu trúc học phần, bài học, và các mục tiêu cụ thể mà người tham gia cần hoàn thành để đạt được mục tiêu lớn của workshop. Đây có thể coi là khung chương trình của workshop. Phần này được thực hiện trong Buổi 3.

Choice of a Teaching Strategy: Lựa chọn một chiến lược truyền tải chung cho toàn bộ và từng phần của workshop. Kết quả của phần này một flow tổng quan của workshop, và những chiến lược (phương pháp) chung để có thể truyền đạt nội dung hiệu quả nhất. Phần này được thực hiện trong Buổi 4 và Buổi 5.

Generation of Learning Tasks: Xây dựng các hoạt động giúp người tham gia học hỏi và hoàn thành được mục tiêu. Kết quả của phần này là những hoạt động cụ thể sẽ diễn ra trong workshop. Phần này được thực hiện trong Buổi 4 và Buổi 5.

Choice of a Delivery System: Lựa chọn công cụ truyền đạt hiệu quả nhất. Kết quả của phần này là những tài liệu, giáo trình, công cụ… cụ thể để thực hiện chương trình. Phần này được thực hiện trong Buổi 6.

Bên cạnh đó, phần Design and Development of Learning Environments (Thiết kế và xây dựng môi trường học hỏi) muốn nói đến những đặc điểm mà một môi trường học hỏi hiệu quả cần có được. Đó chính là những yếu tố mà người thiết kế cần đảm bảo trong quá trình lựa chọn chiến lược truyền đạt và xây dựng hoạt động của mình.

Phần Instructional modeling (Làm mẫu) muốn nói đến việc người học cần có một “hình mẫu chuẩn mực” để làm theo trong workshop.

Implementation: Thực hiện chương trình. Những lưu ý về thực hiện chương trình sẽ được thực hiện trong Buổi 7, Buổi 8.

Evaluation: Đánh giá chương trình và sau đó quay lại bước đầu tiên để điều chỉnh và làm lại.

Mỗi Module chính là một buổi học trên Zoom, và phần bài tập tương ứng với buổi học đó.
