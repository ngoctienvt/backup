- Some of my ideas for this are:
    - deleting the old notes that fully used its value
    - carefully choosing the keywords and ideas
    - try to link the ideas in a specific way instead of broad categories. Or if there is a broad category, then work top-down to [breakdown](<breakdown.md>) them to all the ideas or topics related.
- What's the real concern that I worry here?
    - I worry if I lost the value of my writing notes. [values](<values.md>)
    - I worry if my Roam Research becomes cluster and I need to reread too many notes, even the one that got used instead of just working on the new things that I haven't resolved. [clustering](<clustering.md>)
    - [ ] There is a [fear of missing out](<fear of missing out.md>) and wasting resources here. I need to work on this.

-  [mind-training](<mind-training.md>) I'm thinking that how could I clean up the fleeting notes that got used to permanent notes without losing their values in an [convenient](<convenient.md>) way, so that my [Roam Research](<Roam Research.md>) personal knowledge garden can grow up in a helpful way and not become cluster over time.
