- [Spirit Island](<Spirit Island.md>) could taught me about that even though the end goal is the same. In each different stage, there will be a different thing need to be focus on. [Focus on babystep](<Focus on babystep.md>)
    - In early stage, the importance point is growing instead of focusing on how to win. The reason is as long as we grow, we will expand ourselves with more choices and more abilities to complete the things that we can't in the beginning. [From impossible to possible](<From impossible to possible.md>)
        - #[my quotes](<my quotes.md>) With grow, we expand ourselves to more choices. What seems impossible will become possible along with our growth. 
            - Our current level limit our imagination, so instead of focus on where we are, focus on where we want to be and what we need to grow instead.
    - In the later stage, the strategy will start to form based on our abilities or strengths, this is where we consider how we could win the game, and focus on how to win the game. Or in the general term, how we will reach the end goal. 
- In the last night when I hearing the teaching of Michael Singer, I learned that the experiences that I want to seek for experiences is how I would feel when I'm on later stage of chakra. [Happiness from experiences](<Happiness from experiences.md>)
    - This is really the thing that's based on my higher-self, not based on my lower-self for its short-term pleasure. 
    - There will be desire or want that comes from my higher-self, and this is what I need to follow, not what my lower-self determined. [true desire](<true desire.md>)
        - True desire will not about control the world, but about surrender the inner world, so that we can experience the truth of the world.
    - Other thing I learned is the fourth chakra [Heart chakra](<Heart chakra.md>) is about letting go of the personal self, just like the lower chakra is letting go the sexual desire or the need for survival. [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>)
        - It's not about being control by the sexual desire or survival, it's about how to handle them and not be controlled by them, but rather being center and have choices.
        - It's the same for going to the 4th level. It's about not be controlled by the personal needs, but rather being and let the energy freely flow up to serve the reality, serve others instead of serve ourselves.
            - It's about unconditional love, unconditional serving, self-lessness, centering, clarity, about things that greater than us, contribute for the reality/ the world.
            - It's about the pull of our lower-self are still there, but we are not pulled by them anymore, we are grounded and unattached enough so that it couldn't pull us. 
                - Our focus is now on the higher things instead of lower things, on what we want to focus on instead of being distracted. [undistracted intention](<undistracted intention.md>)
- What could I do will bring me towards becoming a [Productive Spiritual Being](<Productive Spiritual Being.md>)
    - Visualize more

    - The reason why we need to break down the [end goal](<end goal.md>) is because it's hard to connect ourselves to something that are too big and not clear.
        - By breaking down, we break it to small parts so that we can easier to visualize and embrace them in context.
- The teaching of Vishen is pretty clear and straightforward. It really helps me to clarity the how and what's happen, and how to bring my best self and best intention to the world. Though I will take time to create my own system and my own teachings, I feel really grateful for all the things that I learned and that happened to me.
    - My ideal [spiritual practices](<spiritual practices.md>) would be about the merging and surrender technique.
        - And I will use the creative visualization techniques to clarify my end goals and who I need to become, what I will act, and how I will behave as a way to focus on the right thing.
- I know that the course I want to teach next seems to big and I'm just on a beginner stage. But the direction is pretty clear for me, and all I need is to practice and clarify more, while let my own system emerge. This will be a life-changing course that I could teach based on my own life. I will learn to become much more truthful, authentic and vulnerable while creating this course. [ðŸŒ±Training Course - Effortless Growth](<ðŸŒ±Training Course - Effortless Growth.md>)
    - My course will emphasize on self-lessness and growth instead of personal needs, so whatever we will want to do or achieve will for the sake of a meaningful end goal. 
- I'm not so sure why but I love [@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh](<@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh.md>) so much that I want to overcome every challenge between us, so that we can be a happy couple that go through this life time together. We will share joy, happiness, challenges, and enjoy the journey together.
- [life navigation map](<life navigation map.md>) the end goal and where we are now tend to be have a big gap. How we will meet our end goal is unlimited ways and we never know, but we can always know what we could do to achieve the end goal. And we can create some nearer target to reach the end goal. 
    - As long as these directions are clear and ensure that we on the right track. 
    - Then along the way, we will reflect sometimes and consider to change the focus or the how later.
