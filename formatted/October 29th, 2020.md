- My focus now will be about my [coaching skills](<coaching skills.md>). 
    - The skill will be focus on is [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>), so that I could feel comfortable with accepting the perfect people that in front of me. 
    - What I meant [perfect](<perfect.md>) here is not they are perfect as how I want so that I feel good and not feel disturbed inside. [perfect](<perfect.md>) here means that they are the perfect result of their past experiences, of all the forces that created the universe and they are perfect inside.
    - So learning to enjoy the moment in front of me without the [personal needs](<personal needs.md>) to change it so that it will be make me feel good is the most important thing to develop my [coaching presence](<coaching presence.md>). 

I will be presence myself to interact with them as a whole, not to use them to interact with my inner [samskaras](<samskaras.md>).
        - The second coach skills I want to focus is [deep listening](<deep listening.md>). It's about make room for clients to express their inner environment and understand their inner situation, instead of listen to give solutions.
        - Without [deep listening](<deep listening.md>) to understand the clients, how could I support them to navigate through their inner environments, to see them clearly and to empower them to handle their stuffs, so that they can achieve what they truly want. 
        - [true freedom](<true freedom.md>) and [true happiness](<true happiness.md>) are what everyone want, every goal if I look deeply, it only based on two things [end goals](<end goals.md>)
        - One is the inner samskaras so that we could satisfy its need
            - Two is the inner shakti that feed you with tremendous happiness, joy, peace, and you want to express it outside to raise the external moments up.
- I will focus on learning [Course - Effortless Output with Roam](<Course - Effortless Output with Roam.md>) next week, so that I could learn to use Roam more effectively, and get input to build my [journaling training](<journaling training.md>) as well.
- Last night, I learnt that I put my [point of focus](<point of focus.md>) in the wrong thing, and this make lead me to do things ineffectively, because the lack of direction. Instead of put myself to what my mind want to do, I need to put on what the reality truly need instead. 

How to know what the reality truly need? It's about examining our behaviors, way of living, about seeing how ourselves truly live, instead of based on the world that our mind created. [demand of reality](<demand of reality.md>) [bridging](<bridging.md>) [soul-guidance](<soul-guidance.md>)
    - [the impersonal world](<the impersonal world.md>) is the reality that truly happens and can't be wrong.
    - [the makeup world](<the makeup world.md>) is the world that made by our mind based on our samskaras, and it has nothing to do with [the impersonal world](<the impersonal world.md>)
- How can I see like as a [continuous process](<continuous process.md>) is still what I'm not really clear. I still have the tendency to breakdown life, and not able to fully integrate my way of looking it yet.
- [Kindle Highlights Formatter](https://kindle-formatter.vercel.app/)
- [Articles - Start a blog](<Articles - Start a blog.md>)
- I noticed that deep inside of me, the bridge that I want to connect my trueself and the reality is an [unshakable intention](<unshakable intention.md>) that will be a [polestar of my life](<polestar of my life.md>) which I can always come back on, and never replace it, but rather development become stronger over time.
    - This [unshakable intention](<unshakable intention.md>) will not based on my ego-self but [bridging](<bridging.md>) my trueself and [the impersonal world](<the impersonal world.md>).
        - Inside of me, there are still exists many different intention that based on ego-self like money-oriented or pleasure-oriented that try to pull me out of my trueself. [ego-guidance](<ego-guidance.md>)
        - Instead of that, my [unshakable intention](<unshakable intention.md>) would be kind of based on my [soul-guidance](<soul-guidance.md>) with value-oriented or service-oriented to [the impersonal world](<the impersonal world.md>). Everything else is just a tool to support me, and the fact that I'm alive and have the chance to experience will be more than enough for me. [abundance appreciation](<abundance appreciation.md>)
- I also noticed that there is a big fear, a big limitation for me to go beyond myself to embrace the wholeness of the world when I think about going [international](<international.md>), going beyond my [Vietnamese](<Vietnamese.md>) and drop myself to the ocean of the vast world that are separated unconsciously. [wholeness](<wholeness.md>) [beyond personal-self](<beyond personal-self.md>)

- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) Today when I coach for [Nguyễn Thúy Hằng](<Nguyễn Thúy Hằng.md>), I felt so much relief and have more trust for myself, because I can see the result of my coaching that truly satisfy my desire for [sustainable development](<sustainable development.md>) and not just work on the surface. 
    - My [fear](<fear.md>) about trying to have the good result is shifting to [trust the process](<trust the process.md>) by doing what feel right at the moment. I can always improve it later.
    - It's funny to see a [coaching metaphor](<coaching metaphor.md>) about the way of [living without causing harm](<living without causing harm.md>) that I used to use before reappear again. Everyone have a hard time following their samskaras and cause them to live a life that make them smaller instead of expand themselves. [self expanding](<self expanding.md>)
    - I still have a tendency to give advices though I'm not sure that it will necessary or not. The reason is because I have the [need for perfect](<need for perfect.md>). And this need is to serve myself, not the person in front of me. [perfect](<perfect.md>) I want to let go this need for perfect, and embrace [trust the process](<trust the process.md>) instead, because no one can plan their future, they grow continuously through experiences and new awareness.
- I felt so good this tonight, just feel so relax and ease inside of me. Because I really can feel that my path is truly [on the right track](<on the right track.md>). There are still many things that I haven't cleaned yet, but they are reducing day by day, and I become more free and even more expand through that process.
