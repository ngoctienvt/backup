- I start to feel that I have a fear and unreadiness within me, but it's not come from the heart, but mostly come from the consciousness itself. The fear of having to adopt to the way other people will look and response to me diffrently. The fear of an unending growing of responsibilities that will come to me and I will not be able to handle them.
- I notice that Weed have a super strong ability to grow sustainable while I don't have that strength. I tend to jump in and out around, find a fast way to get something/ to feel strong with some tricks and external reliances rather than sustainable inner development.
    - However, there is something I feel that I'm not able to catch yet, but I still have certain strengths that will help me to grow sustainable in a true way. It's hidden somewhere from where I can maintain focus while at the same time learning and improving slowly. [Utilize Strengths](<Utilize Strengths.md>)
        - The experiences that somehow like when I learn to reach high rank on Li√™n Qu√¢n or when I learn to good at math, or when I truly want to win on something.
            - There is something that I do in those moment that make me grow super fast and need to discover, grasp, and establish within me.
- When trying VLTK, I notice that I'm easily get into the game and be exhaust energy fast that I'm just realizing I have been drowning in it later. [enjoy the process](<enjoy the process.md>)
    - I also can't enjoy the game as it is, I just try to see something magnificent, feel certain satisfaction, try to open or match something within me that bring pleasure, satisfy feeling.
        - This lead to the fact that I don't enjoy the game, or even if I enjoy momentarily, it won't last long.
        - This maybe also the reason that I feel hard to enjoy open world game as I feel no direction to grow, to match those enjoyments, it forces me into a situation that instead of passively expecting those moments will happen, I need to learn to consciously creating them instead.

    - I noticed that the way I coach is still a few step ahead my clients, and I seem like not giving them enough room to call out their wisdom, let them have time to learn to think, to come out their own answers, and to experiment them by themselves.
    - I noticed that I still have some fears about they won't be success after the session, they don't feel the matching-pleasure that I'm always expect for my self, so the way I coach somehow have a hidden intention to create those moments.
        - But somehow deeply need to change here, those moments need to happen naturally through the evolution of the clients, instead of going ahead and trying to lead them come into it.
        - I need to learn to be more patience, let go of any needs and fears, trust the unknown, take the time for growing happen, trust the coaching process, and trust the most important aspect of coaching is not what clients achieve, but rather the experience of growing naturally through struggle, breakdown, and breakthrough.
            - It's all about what happen in the process, rather than those matching-satisfaction moments.
