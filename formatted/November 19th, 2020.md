- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) I still that I'm not able to coach as a level that I want. I will dedicate a period of my time to reflect back the whole coaching competency of myself and develop a plan to raise it to become a true PCC or MCC coach, to meet the level that I want to coach other people.

- It's resonate to me that level of thinking is heavily affected by the level of abstraction. [level of thinking](<level of thinking.md>)
Abstract is something that's not easy to visualize and think about, while concrete thinking is much easier to relate to.

    - While I'm doing as a life coach, it's common to see that people are limit their own thinking by what they can think of, instead of just think about what they're truly want.
    - If they want to go to America, they will say that they want to have a promotion instead. Because the promotion will help them to have money to buy tickets, so that it will POSSIBLE for them to go to America.
    - This way of thinking is focus on the solution that already have in their head, and the [means goal](<means goal.md>) to help them moving forward that solution.
    - However, it's an unhelpful approach, because they limit the solution that they can have in the beginning, they also limit that they need to complete these mean goals so that they can possible to achieve what they want.
    - It's not that it's wrong, it's just that's it's ineffective, and more often, it will make you merry-go-around instead of directly ensure you to achieve your end goal.
