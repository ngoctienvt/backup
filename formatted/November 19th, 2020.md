- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) I still that I'm not able to coach as a level that I want. I will dedicate a period of my time to reflect back the whole coaching competency of myself and develop a plan to raise it to become a true PCC or MCC coach, to meet the level that I want to coach other people.

- It's resonate to me that level of thinking is heavily affected by the level of abstraction. [level of thinking](<level of thinking.md>)
Abstract is something that's not easy to visualize and think about, while concrete thinking is much easier to relate to.

    - While I'm doing as a life coach, it's common to see that people are limit their own thinking by what they can think of, instead of just think about what they're truly want.
    - If they want to go to America, they will say that they want to have a promotion instead. Because the promotion will help them to have money to buy tickets, so that it will POSSIBLE for them to go to America.
    - This way of thinking is focus on the solution that already have in their head, and the [means goal](<means goal.md>) to help them moving forward that solution.
    - However, it's an unhelpful approach, because they limit the solution that they can have in the beginning, they also limit that they need to complete these mean goals so that they can possible to achieve what they want.
    - It's not that it's wrong, it's just that's it's ineffective, and more often, it will make you merry-go-around instead of directly ensure you to achieve your end goal.
- [daily reflection](<daily reflection.md>) Today I felt that there are few important things that emerging.
    - One is I start to write [Evergreen notes](<Evergreen notes.md>), and I'm not sure how I will handle them yet, but I will focus on them next for my PKDS projects
    - Second is I'm starting to learn to organize my life productively by learning about the system of [Ali Abdaal](<Ali Abdaal.md>) and integrating them with my [Workflow MOC](<Workflow MOC.md>)
    - Third is I'm more and more see the power of [bottom-up approach](<bottom-up approach.md>), because they help me to build things naturally and always on the right track. Because the focus point is me, and what's here instead of other people and their ways.
    - Fourth is coaching is an important [area of focus](<area of focus.md>) that I'm not building yet, and I will spend my time for it soon.
    - This year has been a year of overwhelming for me. Even now I'm looking back, I still can't imagine how much I change from this year and how much things has happened on my life. Many events from 
        - starting my small company, 
        - have conflicts with my parents and break up with Thục Linh, 
        - learning to embrace and let go my fear, need, anger, 
        - developing my personal knowledge development system
        - have a coach training, spiritual teaching
        - choose to follow the international direction, to embrace a bigger world directly by becoming a blogger
        - and next will be learning about instructional design, and see the big picture of trainer, ID, and expert
        - to surrender myself more to the reality instead of resist and avoid to embrace responsibilities
        - to re-connect with Mỹ Linh
        - to shift myself to become a much more compress, clarity, lean stage of being
- [my quotes](<my quotes.md>) The ability to identify what’s true instead of what’s seem to be true is the difference between a wise people and a maybe wise people.
