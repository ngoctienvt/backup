-  This week focus:

- Last night [dream](<dream.md>), I have a fear about bad things, unpleasant things, I feel so much disturbed that I feel hard to center and let go. I need to remember that everything is just energy nurture energy, they are the energy of experiences that come to nurture me - the soul - the energy, so there is no need to fear and resist. They will not be able to harm me, but only teach me the nature of everything.

The reason I fear and resist is I thought that they will harm me, but I'm not the physical person, I'm the energy that can't die, and impressions, samskaras can't kill me.
- About the front door, I start to learn to feel safe and put more trust into the reality. I learn to let go my attachment for stuff and the feeling of owning something. [fear](<fear.md>)
- [🌱My Coaching Reflection](<🌱My Coaching Reflection.md>) I noticed that sometimes I couldn't just reflect and question, sometimes I need to have clients to have some options to clarify their thoughts, especially when they keep going around. This is the same as me, as I'm on a stage learning how to facilitate my own thoughts to become clearer and directional by learning the MOCs stage.

The situation also needs to be specific to explore, as clients can easily relate to their context and learn from that. I can also learn more on them based on that situation rather than work as general context.

- I started to realize that there will be something that needs to come directly from me, instead of just things emerge from my thoughts. Without the [truth compass](<truth compass.md>) that hold the intention that comes from within myself, it's hard for me to guide the tools, the thoughts, whatever I do to connect to each other and to fully integrate into one. [oneness](<oneness.md>). 

The truth compass or [soul-guidance](<soul-guidance.md>) needs to be clarified so that I could have a direction to merge my MOCs into a way that support the intention that I want to live my life. For example, everything needs to support me to free myself or attach with only myself [true freedom](<true freedom.md>), to be the blessing on the world by being an instrument for the unfolding life. 
- Each [🧭Map of Contents](<🧭Map of Contents.md>) will need to be linked to my [soul-guidance](<soul-guidance.md>) or have clear roles so that it will make sure me to always on the right track, as well as have a clear direction for my work. Now I start to work from top to bottom, and somehow bottom to top to meet them in a middle. It is the connection between me - my true self, the reality and what is in between that I need to work on?

A clear boundary will help me to easy to focus on the middle. I become more and more clear about me and what would be the process for me to live my life to live this life to its fullest without the fear illusion.
