- [📝Weekly Review](<📝Weekly Review.md>)
    - Highlight of the weeks:
        - I start to work on my accumulated knowledge as well as process new knowledge at the same time
            - Collecting/ Note-taking and grouping
            - Then integrating the knowledge
        - I free myself more and yearn to true relationship, go far beyond the body sexual needs which is the manifest of low level chakra that still personal.
        - I learn more effectively through my PKDS and let go practices.
        - I start to go from top to down, abstract to concrete, whole to parts, this will be a tremendous growth for me when I'm able to do this.
    - Success factors
        - I take back my willpower more this week
        - I meditate more when I don't know what I need to do
        - I focus on do what I can see first like take note courses, highlight ebooks, so that the results of these are the materials for my next stages, instead of trying to see the whole process at once.

- If I want to write and publish something, it will be at least from a competent level or proficiency level. These levels will provide values in a concise and much more helpful. And it will go through enough process to make sure that’s it works and it’s not coming from my personal emotions. [public output](<public output.md>)

    - End goal
    - It is very helpful if we can clarify our end goal so that it will become the pole star to ensure that's we focus on the right thing, instead of lost ourselves on the mean goals.
    - End goal also help us to less attach to tools, current methods, or stay in our comfort zone.
        - It requires us to go beyond what we're familiar and not let us limit ourselves in our current ability, but stretch us or provoke our creativity to make sure that's we are on the right track.
