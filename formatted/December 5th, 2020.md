- [weekly reflection](<weekly reflection.md>)
    - Highlight of the weeks:
        - I start to work on my accumulated knowledge as well as process new knowledge at the same time
            - Collecting/ Note-taking and grouping
            - Then integrating the knowledge
        - I free myself more and yearn to true relationship, go far beyond the body sexual needs which is the manifest of low level chakra that still personal.
        - I learn more effectively through my PKDS and let go practices.
        - I start to go from top to down, abstract to concrete, whole to parts, this will be a tremendous growth for me when I'm able to do this.
    - Success factors
        - I take back my willpower more this week
        - I meditate more when I don't know what I need to do
        - I focus on do what I can see first like take note courses, highlight ebooks, so that the results of these are the materials for my next stages, instead of trying to see the whole process at once.
    - [ðŸŽ¯Focus of the week](<ðŸŽ¯Focus of the week.md>)
    - In this weekend, I will do 
        - synthesize the second lectures
        - my first exercise of Design Lean Workshop
        - meditate on my relationship with Linh and have a message response for her
        - Take note the 4th video of spiritual course
- If I want to write and publish something, it will be at least from a competent level or proficiency level. These levels will provide values in a concise and much more helpful. And it will go through enough process to make sure thatâ€™s it works and itâ€™s not coming from my personal emotions.
