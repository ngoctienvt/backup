- I felt so much emotions inside my heart last night. I felt that I'm so disturb, and angy when people or things I respect was judged by other people. I also felt uncomfortable with people who judge other people because I fear that it will misleading other people in the wrong direction.
- I realized that what's best I can do for now is focus on myself, let my work do the talk, less talk and more accept/ more release. I will not let my personal needs or samskaras blur out my ability to respect the reality. I am feel much more happy that this is my chance for gradually expand my ability to embrace reality and let go of my personal stuff, especially the one that have attachments with my preferences.
- What I need to focus on is not myself, my career, or the person, I need to focus on release my internal stuff so that I don't have to protect these personal stuff, and put the people I care about above them.
- Last night, I dream and notice that I want to win and hate to lose, this is because I'm so identified with my need of recognition but forget that's what's important is the person, not my stuff.
- Today I will have a chat with [@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh](<@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh.md>). And I want to take less time to talk about myself, but rather relax, conscious at the moment and let myself embrace her. And let my inner shakti do the work to take care of her, respect her, give her space for growth.
- The way a person develop their [Level of expertise](<Level of expertise.md>) is start with
    - Creating a space for their skill development
    - Deepen their skill on that space
    - Expand gradually
    - From general to context
    - From low perspective to high perspective
    - From surface understanding to deep understanding
    - From practice to master to show the work
    - From ambiguous to clear and clarity
    - From verbose to concrete and concise
- I noticed that general is for low-level of understanding, while in high level, it's require given concext so that's people can learn from the context and then level up their own understanding. [level of thinking](<level of thinking.md>)
- I had some notions about designing a process or a sequence of activities to level up my expertise by myself. It will need the combination of [level of thinking](<level of thinking.md>) and [Level of expertise](<Level of expertise.md>). [self-learning](<self-learning.md>)
    - It's like I know what's require to come up to the next step, so I come to the next step and design what's needed to help me come to that step through certain practices.
    - This approach will help me to focus and aim to the right direction, instead of let myself learn freely and just let them develop naturally all the time.
    - There will be certain levels that it's helpful to develop naturally like Beginner to the early of Competent. Or from scatter thoughts and knowledge to the point that it requires me to synthesize and integrate.
    - I also noticed that it's very important for me to develop [My Personal Mission Statement](<My Personal Mission Statement.md>) that helps me to focus on what I want to do from a top-down point of view, instead of just going around all the tools and knowledge like now. Because there will be no end for bottom-up, a certain top-down is helpful for contributing and deepening my expertise.
- [ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach](<ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach.md>)
    - The role of [ðŸŒ²Bottom-up Emergence](<ðŸŒ²Bottom-up Emergence.md>) is nurture and gather necessary materials, especially the quality one.
    - The role [ðŸŒ²Top-down Processing](<ðŸŒ²Top-down Processing.md>) is making products from the materials gathered, while nurture new things for new products or projects.
    - This is a circle of learning that we become better at create better products over time by improving the quality of materials as well as the skills to create quality products.
    - It's important to release the fear of waste because there is nothing waste. It's all serving for the learning and development process, while contributing to the world as the same time.
        - We are all on a part of a big kindergarten that's the main purpose for us are learning.
