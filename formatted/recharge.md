- I felt tired today and feel that I need to [recharge](<recharge.md>)

It could be [physical energy](<physical energy.md>) but I feel tired even when I fall asleep, so something is more than that and would be about the way I recharge my energy [recharge](<recharge.md>)

- Another reason is my [physical energy](<physical energy.md>) also disappeared and expended too much.  I will need to improve my physical body so that it can retain stored energy effectively. I also need to release some counter-intuitive activities so I can [recharge](<recharge.md>)
