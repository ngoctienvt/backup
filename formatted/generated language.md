- I noticed that my language about learning needs to change before I use words that describe "I still weak, still not strong enough". This way is basically saying that I'm not able to meet this challenge, but this is an unhelpful way of thinking because apparently, we aren't able to handle the challenge yet, so we are not enough for this. [generated language](<generated language.md>)

Instead of looking at I'm not enough because this is the fact already, I can use [generated language](<generated language.md>)

- My [coaching](<coaching.md>) method is still not clear about the [being coaching](<being coaching.md>). I also want to work more on this.
