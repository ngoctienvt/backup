- The thinking that made me felt right about releasing anger into other people is they didn't treat me well when things I didn't like or I didn't able to handle yet happen to me. At that moment, I felt the need to make myself better because I felt disturbed inside, so releasing anger helped me to feel better. But this is not a long-term solution, the root cause is I can't handle the event that happened to me and I count on other people to help me handle it unconsciously. [root cause](<root cause.md>)

- In [coaching](<coaching.md>), coach turn off [compressed process](<compressed process.md>) of their mind and let the clients in charge this process in their own inner universe. This means that the clients will provoke their thinking, and active their own mind to generate higher thinking level. This process also requires clients face what's the [underlying concern](<underlying concern.md>) or the [root cause](<root cause.md>)
