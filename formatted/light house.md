- I feel that it will take time for me to truly practice my spiritual path first. I will focus on [PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System MOC](<PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System MOC.md>) and coaching for the next period of time. And still spend time for my own to free myself first. I will learn to master and support others while I'm mastering things as well. But at least I need to go further ahead enough so that's I can become a proper tour guide for them. [training method](<training method.md>) [light house](<light house.md>)
