                - Coaching emphasizes experiencing the present moment and shifting perspective and viewpoint. 
                    - Unlike some types of therapy, it doesn’t focus deeply on the past. The emphasis is on what is possible in the present looking toward the future.
                -  Coaching involves forming a partnership with your client to help them move forward in ways that are authentically satisfying.
                    -  Satisfaction can come from resolving situations, dilemmas, conflicts, and concerns, and from figuring out how to create, grow, and expand.
                -  Coaching is about finding a way to change what isn’t working or improving on something that is working. 
                    - It addresses desires, problems, or situations in the present.
                - Coaching uses powerful techniques (tools, support, and structure) to help clients clarify and stay focused on their priorities.
                - The process of coaching can contribute to creating prosperity, balance, and fulfillment in all areas of life. 
                    - Through coaching, a client can achieve their vision (what they want in life) by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Each conversation moves the client closer to what they really want.
                    - Talking with a friend can be helpful, but coaching offers undistracted listening that is non-judgmental, trusting, honest, and exceptionally objective
                - A coach is a resource with a large tool kit for assisting clients in developing and pursuing their vision, so they achieve positive and permanent results. 
            - The coaching process can be broken down into three simple and easy steps: [coaching process](<coaching process.md>)
                - 1. Identify the ideas, thoughts, or beliefs that keep your client from getting what they want. 
                - 2. Help them shift their perspective so that they can feel good about themselves and move forward. 
                - 3. Help them capitalize on their strengths to achieve fulfillment and their full potential.
            - Coaches accomplish this by finding out where their client is now, what their ideal situation is, and how to close the gap between the two. 
                - All coaching has the same focus — to help the client:
                    -  Become more self-aware 
                    - Discover what is keeping them “stuck” 
                    - Create more prosperity, balance, and fulfillment in their life and/or work
        - The laser-focused coaching approach
            - Major distinctions with general coaching
                - The coach truly focuses on the client — who the person is, what they think is true, how they behave, and what they value.
                - The coach is able to completely release the need to perform or prove their value.
                    - As opposed to focusing on results, the intention is on purposeful exploration leading organically to long-term transformation that affects all areas of a client’s life.
                    - The client naturally creates their own forward movement from a highly motivated perspective. 
                        - From the literal first question, more profound, insightful coaching is underway.
                    - Coach knows how to create and demonstrate a collaborative relationship by providing context for questions and pertinent reflection.
                        - It’s not about focusing on solving the problematic situation because the solution is actually a by-product. 
                        - Trying to get to a solution or action plan before exploring the client’s thinking, behavior, ideas, and values is the same as asking an inappropriate question such as “How much money do you make?”
                - Most people think coaching is about helping clients. While we do help them, that is not our aim in Laser-Focused Coaching. 
                    - __Our role is to shine a light on something our client cannot see for themselves. __
                        - And with that light, clients discover things they couldn’t see before, thus helping becomes the by-product .
        - CONVENTIONAL COACHING VERSUS LASERFOCUSED COACHING
            - The most common approach to coaching usually follows a learned formula or model to solve a problem.
                -  The focus is on action and results, making sure the client takes specific steps before the next session. 
                - Typical coaching starts with accepting at face value what the client shares. 
                    - Emphasis is frequently placed on agreeing on the outcome the client requests from the beginning, and then working toward that. 
                    - The coach typically assists the client in designing an action, and then manages accountability. 
                - With this type of coaching, the coach can feel pressure to perform and find solutions to be seen as worthy. 
                    - Often the coach fails to realize that they are not responsible for any outcome, and consequently gathers more information than is actually needed.
                        - This focus on collecting data prevents efficient and more meaningful coaching.
                - While the client might seem temporarily pleased, neither the coach nor the client realizes how much more could have come from the coaching had the underlying issue been addressed at the root.
