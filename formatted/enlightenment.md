- Whatever the [consciousness](<consciousness.md>) [identify](<identify.md>) it with, the consciousness acquires the characteristic of what its identified with. If you identify with fear, you feel fear. If you identify with the breath, you feel neutral. If you identify with love, you feel love. If consciousness identified itself, it will know the characteristic of itself [enlightenment](<enlightenment.md>)

- When watching GAGA, I realized that I have a [moment](<moment.md>) that the song that I heard went directly to myself and get past the inner world that I built inside. This experience makes me really feel that the current moment has gone all the way in because there is a little hole for it leaks in before it got block by the things that I hold inside and stimulate them instead.
