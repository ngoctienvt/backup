- It feels quite uncomfortable and not natural to clean up the bottom-up approach. [Expanding questions](<Expanding questions.md>)
    - I'm not totally clear about what I could generalize to capture [entirety of an atomic concept](<entirety of an atomic concept.md>) [generalization](<generalization.md>) [contextual usages](<contextual usages.md>)
    - How I will clean what's not the main point? [Roam's writing structure](<Roam's writing structure.md>)
        - Should I come to the main point and clean it now? or
        - Should I just remove the link, so it will clean on this bottom-up approach page?
        - What should be my way to structure my daily note writing, 
            - so that the inbox will SHOW what the thoughts truly about, 
            - and how should I tag things intentionally, so that's they will not cluster page?
            - What's the reason for me to tag freely before?
- I'm on a [transition stage](<transition stage.md>) that shift myself from the imposing structure of social to comeback to [ðŸŒ±Unshakable Centering](<ðŸŒ±Unshakable Centering.md>) so that I could operate in a way that true harmony with reality, not society.
- [my quotes](<my quotes.md>)
[true harmony](<true harmony.md>) is the harmony between our true self and reality, not the ego self and society.
- My [mindset](<mindset.md>) is now from the higher-self and the rest of the lower-self. 
    - For example, grateful and ungrateful. Love and no love, Respect and unrespect. There is no need to care the differences of lower-self. Just need to know it is lower-self to aim to higher-self. [indifferentiated](<indifferentiated.md>)
- I noticed that if I want to tag something, it could not be my free-thoughts, but rather the [high-value information blocks that got process a bit and want to process more. [[Tag usage](<high-value information blocks that got process a bit and want to process more. [[Tag usage.md>)
- I feel much better when starting processing bottom-up approach to learn about my [compressed process](<compressed process.md>)
    - **[Key takeaways](<Key takeaways.md>):**
        - Some [types of information block](<types of information block.md>) that I started to see when processing bottom-up approach concepts are
            - real life application
            - definition
            - benefits 
            - characteristics
            - procedure
-

- [types of blog](<types of blog.md>)
    - digital garden
    - flourish-content blog
    - business blog
- [threaded thinking](<threaded thinking.md>) instead of [linear thinking](<linear thinking.md>)
    - Thinking is not only non-linear, it's messy. It involves a lot of back and forth, dead ends, branching, walking back, merging ideas, changing ideas, contradicting ideas. When I picture what my thoughts look likeâ€”the actual process of navigating different ideas in my headâ€”I don't see a nice straight road with check points, I see a massive web of tangled threads.
    -  The ideal tool for thought would embrace the messiness of our minds, and organically help insights emerge from chaos instead of forcing an artificial order. [condition for emergence](<condition for emergence.md>)
