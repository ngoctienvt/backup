- It feels quite uncomfortable and not natural to clean up the bottom-up approach. [Expanding questions](<Expanding questions.md>)
    - I'm not totally clear about what I could generalize to capture [entirety of an atomic concept](<entirety of an atomic concept.md>) [generalization](<generalization.md>) [contextual usages](<contextual usages.md>)
    - How I will clean what's not the main point? [Roam's writing structure](<Roam's writing structure.md>)
        - Should I come to the main point and clean it now? or
        - Should I just remove the link, so it will clean on this bottom-up approach page?
        - What should be my way to structure my daily note writing, 
            - so that the inbox will SHOW what the thoughts truly about, 
            - and how should I tag things intentionally, so that's they will not cluster page?
            - What's the reason for me to tag freely before?
    - What woul be my [workflow](<workflow.md>) for daily notes and seek clarity for what I'm working on?
- I'm on a [transition stage](<transition stage.md>) that shift myself from the imposing structure of social to comeback to [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>) so that I could operate in a way that true harmony with reality, not society.
- [my quotes](<my quotes.md>)
[true harmony](<true harmony.md>) is the harmony between our true self and reality, not the ego self and society.
- My [mindset](<mindset.md>) is now from the higher-self and the rest of the lower-self. 
    - For example, grateful and ungrateful. Love and no love, Respect and unrespect. There is no need to care the differences of lower-self. Just need to know it is lower-self to aim to higher-self. [indifferentiated](<indifferentiated.md>)
- I noticed that if I want to tag something, it could not be my free-thoughts, but rather the [high-value information blocks](<high-value information blocks.md>) that got process a bit and want to process more.
- I feel much better when starting processing bottom-up approach to learn about my [compressed process](<compressed process.md>)
    - **[Key takeaways](<Key takeaways.md>):**
        - Some [types of information blocks](<types of information blocks.md>) that I started to see when processing bottom-up approach concepts are
            - real life application
            - definition
            - benefits 
            - characteristics
            - procedure
- I noticed that the workflow of the writing is looks like this [writing workflow](<writing workflow.md>) [workflow](<workflow.md>)
    - Collecting external materials and transient thoughts
    - Processing to [high-value information blocks](<high-value information blocks.md>)
    - Processing to [compressed understanding](<compressed understanding.md>)
    - Generating pieces of output notes
    - Collecting and edit pieces of output notes to become an high-quality article or blog post. 
- [ ] working on workflow process again
- The relationship between [evergreen garden](<evergreen garden.md>) and [journey of wisdom](<journey of wisdom.md>)
    - watering ideas, seeds
    - cleaning [clustering](<clustering.md>) weeds
    - wither, resurface or flourish seeds
    - **Streams** - For me this is twitter and is more than enough stream for now.
    - **Campfires** - For me this is the blog here (and more broadly the blogosphere that I read and engage with). Room to grow here but generally I’m satisfied here.
    - **Gardens** - This is where there’s a gap for me personally. No place to store and evolve deeper longer-term thinking. Many of my friends have gravitated to [Are.na](https://are.na/) but I just can’t get it to work for me.
    - ## A blog without a publish button
        - blogging is mostly performative thinking and less captain’s log. So I am looking for a space to nurture, edit in real time and evolve my thinking.
    - ## A space for collecting the dots
        - It’s more common to think of “connecting the dots” but the truth is that you can’t connect the dots you can’t see.
        - And we can only hold a tiny number of things in our brains at once. So a space for collecting (and organizing) the dots is a crucial foundation for thinking, creativity and more:
        - But ideas aren’t summoned from nowhere: they come from raw material, other ideas or observations about the world. Hence a two-step creative process: collect raw material, then think about it. From this process comes pattern recognition and eventually the insights that form the basis of novel ideas.
    - ## Longevity, text files and folders
        - Firstly - apparently, folders and files is the “best in class” tool (better than tags and search) for personal information management
        - Critics of this method point out that information is hidden from sight in folders that are often within other folders so that we have to remember the exact location of information to access it.
