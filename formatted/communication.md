## [December 30th, 2020](<December 30th, 2020.md>)
- Yesterday, I noticed that I felt very uncomfortable when I react with my mother and my sister came in. I missed understand my mother just want me to be careful. I felt annoy about that, because I don’t feel they understand me and I think that they don’t know that I’m already consider them. When my sister said that I support the bandit, it’s not true and it’s provoking my need to defense myself. the conversation is all about how I felt to be attacked and not understood.
