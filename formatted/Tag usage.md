    - Tagging for direct related-ideas or key topics of the block
    - Try to process them a bit before tagging them. (summary, key take-aways, new insights...) on daily notes or any sources of information
- How to use tags effectively?
    - Tags easy to create association, but not good as describing relationships.
    - In order to use tags more effectively, I will need to learn how to use tags intentionally
        - Tags for explicit associations instead of inferred associations
            - The purpose of tags is how to utilize the connections
            - Tags high-signal or strong connections
        - Tags for specific context
            - Paper X relates to paragraph N
            - Help to see why the "backwards" relationship makes sense
        - Tags for contextual associations
            - “X is related to Y”: better to say “X goes into more detail about Y in the context of Z.”
