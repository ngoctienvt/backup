    - Tags easy to create association, but not good as describing relationships.
    - In order to use tags more effectively, I will need to learn how to use tags intentionally
        - Tags for explicit associations instead of inferred associations
            - The purpose of tags is how to utilize the connections
            - Tags high-signal or strong connections
        - Tags for specific context
            - Paper X relates to paragraph N
            - Help to see why the "backwards" relationship makes sense
