- I felt that I still have a little bit of putting other people higher than myself, instead of realizing that we are the same. Souls are the same, but the identification that we live in makes me feel we are not the same. Some people are better than me. [comparison](<comparison.md>) This makes me feel [nervous](<nervous.md>) and forgets my [trueself](<trueself.md>), and reacts in a way that wants to have [recognition](<recognition.md>).
- There are only 4 broad categories that we need to know. And we need to know the nature of them, not the details. [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>) [understanding](<understanding.md>) 
    - [consciousness](<consciousness.md>)
        - The nature of the [consciousness](<consciousness.md>) is conscious, attention, and experience
    - [the outside world](<the outside world.md>)
        - The nature of the world is existence.
    - [the mind](<the mind.md>)
        - The nature of the mind is 
            - rendering
            - intellectual processing
    - [the heart](<the heart.md>)
        - The nature of the heart is
            - emanating energy, feelings
- I heard the song Love the way you life of [J.Fla](<J.Fla.md>) and felt so admire her for her passion and energy.

- In today's letting go, I started to really develop a desire to come back to my true self and think at that level, instead of the human level. I want to work from the soul level down to the human being level. The reason is if I operate on a human being level, I'm very easy to lose myself in the thinking level that derives from [identification](<identification.md>) with the inner [samskaras](<samskaras.md>). [spiritual growth](<spiritual growth.md>)

In contrast, if my [intention](<intention.md>) fully focuses on cleaning first, I will not have things to identify with and mislead me. This would make everything become much easier and clearer. [level of thinking](<level of thinking.md>)

I also still have too much concern about [money](<money.md>) and try to plan so I will not feel [uncomfortable](<uncomfortable.md>) and [worry](<worry.md>). Instead of that, I want to let go of all of this so I can [appreciate](<appreciate.md>) and always feel [enough](<enough.md>) about what life already offered to me. I also want to surrender myself completely to the universal plan of universe and learn to do the best I can to execute the plan. [attitude](<attitude.md>) [surrender](<surrender.md>)
- I am also learning to expand myself to contain fully all of the lessons and samskaras that people who are important to me teaching me like Mỹ Linh, my parents, Huyền, Hằng, coaching clients... [containing](<containing.md>)
- Today I noticed that my life has always been wanting to go high, but the true high, not what people think but what I really feel and connect with. And that is the inner [spiritual path](<spiritual path.md>), the path to living life as it is, not based on my inner stuff. [true desire](<true desire.md>) In this process, I tried to protect myself, and unrealized that actions also hinder the path to come closer to my [true desire](<true desire.md>). At least, now I'm becoming more and more consciously aware of what I need to do, so the rest is just about focusing on keep moving forward.
