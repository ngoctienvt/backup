- [Progressive Development Approach](<Progressive Development Approach.md>)
    - an approach for natural and effortless personal and professional development
- ## Benefits
    - self-expression /self-uniqueness
    - [natural progression](<natural progression.md>)
        - stress-free
        - sustainable development
    - structured and deep understanding
    - learing to enjoy the process instead of skip through to the goals
- ## Core methods
    -  [Bottom-up Approach MOC](<Bottom-up Approach MOC.md>) for merging with the experiences
        - [integration](<integration.md>)
    -  [Top-down Approach MOC](<Top-down Approach MOC.md>) for focusing myself to certain direction
        - [Evergreen notes](<Evergreen notes.md>)
- ## Core principles
    - living life as a [circular process](<circular process.md>)
        - focused on [enjoy the process](<enjoy the process.md>) or journey instead of a [linear process](<linear process.md>) focused on [results](<results.md>)
        - flow to integration instead of separation
        - see life as continuous process instead of separation stages only [continuous process](<continuous process.md>)
    - build up the emerge structure and solidify them over time 
        - [design for emergence](<design for emergence.md>)
            - [Bottom-up Approach MOC](<Bottom-up Approach MOC.md>) to create [optimal conditions](<optimal conditions.md>) for the emergence of new insights, ideas, solutions, creations in a natural way 
        - building [basic foundation](<basic foundation.md>)
        - flexibility with [contextual mastery](<contextual mastery.md>) and different direction of development (convergence/divergence)
    - ensure the focus on what's truly effective
        - right person
            - [establishing the seat of awareness](<establishing the seat of awareness.md>)
        - right focus
            - breakdown process for easier digesting and productive batching
            - [focus mode](<focus mode.md>) + [diffuse mode](<diffuse mode.md>) = [being mode](<being mode.md>)
            - focus on true progression instead of the feeling of doing something meaningful, like instead of focusing on bolding and highlighting/ focus on self-commentary instead.
                - [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>) to [work at the root](<work at the root.md>)
        - right reflection
            - looping with [built-in feedback loop](<built-in feedback loop.md>)
        - right tools
            - [support system](<support system.md>) to utilize external tools, so internal tools focus energy on what's important 
                - creating an [Evergreen garden](<Evergreen garden.md>) to support thoughts process and store personal knowledge [workspace for intellectual mind](<workspace for intellectual mind.md>)
                - [coaching](<coaching.md>)
        - momentum
            - [setting up for success](<setting up for success.md>) to create [snowball](<snowball.md>)
                - [positive inner feedback loop](<positive inner feedback loop.md>)
- ### Core components:
- ## Supportive components:
- ### What I want to apply this approach
    - way of living
    - personal knowledge development
    - working/ creating products
- In your Dynamic Note Mass, what does that look like?
    - Sometimes __bottoms-up__ creates meaning: Note » MOC » Index
    - Sometimes __top-down__ creates meaning: Index » MOC » Note
    - Sometimes __middle-out__ creates meaning: MOC » Note, and MOC » Index
- The [starting point](<starting point.md>) of everything is established a solidify [basic foundation](<basic foundation.md>) so that I can come back at any time. The role of a basic foundation is to establish a [Top-down Approach MOC](<Top-down Approach MOC.md>), a broad viewpoint that includes things I want to work on. It would help to set me a [truth compass](<truth compass.md>) to come back when I feel lost or to expand myself based on the experience that I gained. [life flow](<life flow.md>) [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>)
    - The reason to have a [starting point](<starting point.md>) is to realize that things have different levels or different progress to work on. [Top-down Approach MOC](<Top-down Approach MOC.md>) The starting point is established by 
        - learning and getting used to what's possible, 
        - what's the floor and what's the possible ceiling?
        - what's the meaning of this?
    - After establishing a starting point, the next thing is about the [mastery](<mastery.md>) process. The process of mastery is what's I actually do in the [Top-down Approach MOC](<Top-down Approach MOC.md>) that I defined. 
        - It's about listing the things that I want to master. The things to master will have different levels as well. 
            - One is to understand the components.
            - Second is to have a synthesis or a goal to use things together. [synthesis](<synthesis.md>)
        - Choose and go deep to acquire a [deeper understanding](<deeper understanding.md>) in each thing [[bottom-up approach
        - Synthesis things by a [Top-down Approach MOC](<Top-down Approach MOC.md>) that have goals, challenges, application oriented as a result.
        - Reflection after each learning to condense knowledges and experiences. [condensing and generative process](<condensing and generative process.md>)
    - The third step is going beyond.
        - Come back to the foundation and start to [[bottom-up approach things.
- I also start to realize the bottom of the floor and the top of the ceiling, so that I could put the clear boundaries or definitions for them, then I can start to work the middle in detail. [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>)
    - The [top of the ceiling](<top of the ceiling.md>) is about all 4 broad elements of the world, the nature of each of them, and the relationship of them.
    - The [bottom of the floor](<bottom of the floor.md>) is about the actual experience of each moment and the interaction of each moment with the 4 elements.
    - The middle is the human life that happens in the world based on the tools that the conscious have: emotions, mind, body.
