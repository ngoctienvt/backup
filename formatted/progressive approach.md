- ## What is progressive approach?
    - a approach of living life to nurture the way of living - [living from the place of surrender](<living from the place of surrender.md>)
        - [deeper understanding](<deeper understanding.md>), 
        - [soul evolution](<soul evolution.md>) 
        - acquire [mastery](<mastery.md>) in a natural and effective way. 
- ## The benefits of progressive approach are:
    - natural and effortless development based on [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>)
    - directly connect with the highest goal of life - [soul evolution](<soul evolution.md>)
    - living a stress-free life
- ## Core methods
    -  [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>) for merging with the experiences
        - [integration activity](<integration activity.md>)
    -  [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) for focusing myself to certain direction
- ## Core principles:
    - living life as a [circular process](<circular process.md>)
        - focused on [enjoy the process](<enjoy the process.md>) or journey instead of a [linear process](<linear process.md>) focused on [results](<results.md>)
    - flexibility with [contextual mastery](<contextual mastery.md>)
    - [design for emergence](<design for emergence.md>)
        - [bottom-up evolution](<bottom-up evolution.md>) to create [optimal conditions](<optimal conditions.md>) for the emergence of new insights, ideas, solutions, creations in a natural way 
    - [natural progression](<natural progression.md>)
    - [establishing the seat of awareness](<establishing the seat of awareness.md>)
- ## Supportive components:
    - [support system](<support system.md>) to utilize external tools, so internal tools focus energy on what's important 
        - creating an [evergreen garden](<evergreen garden.md>) to support thoughts process and store personal knowledge [workspace for intellectual mind](<workspace for intellectual mind.md>)
        - [coaching](<coaching.md>)
    - [setting up for success](<setting up for success.md>) to create [snowball](<snowball.md>)
        - [positive inner feedback loop](<positive inner feedback loop.md>)
    - [getting in touch with reality](<getting in touch with reality.md>) to [work at the root](<work at the root.md>)

- The [starting point](<starting point.md>) of everything is established a solidify [basic foundation](<basic foundation.md>) so that I can come back at any time. The role of a basic foundation is to establish a [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>), a broad viewpoint that includes things I want to work on. It would help to set me a [truth compass](<truth compass.md>) to come back when I feel lost or to expand myself based on the experience that I gained.

I noticed that when I'm approaching things to train others, I like to work from a [top-down boundary](<top-down boundary.md>) as this helps me to ensure that the value and the understanding are there for them. However, this also put pressure too much on my shoulder. Ideally, I want to have some small top-down ideas [breakdown](<breakdown.md>) that I want to develop and work to complete these fragments and train them as well. This is exactly how [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>)

- Everything has different levels, and they only become higher and higher. Just like relaxation. That's why our way of thinking need to be set the intention and destination but focus on where we are, because everything is a [continuous process](<continuous process.md>) without clear starting point and end point.[level of development](<level of development.md>) [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>)
