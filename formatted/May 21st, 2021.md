- I still worry a little bit about tomorrow event because I have tÃªh tendency to do the best as I want
    - I have a self-expectation that it must be valuable for other people the way I expect myself to receive when attending an event
    - In tomorrow event, I will let people start with watching a movie mention about change to make them start to think about how change happens and how we tend to cling to the old self until it is no longer posible
    - Then I will work with them through the way we how usually operate to try to achieve what we want, but we will never satisfy fully about them, and continue to chase the next thing
    - Then I invite them into the new way of we could operate ourselves by seeing things as a reflection to know more about ourselves and guidances for personal growth. Instead of seeking the external outcomes, we focus on the satisfaction that comes from the personal growth, and life becomes a blessing for us to grow infinitely.
    - Then 2 people will share their stories about how they grow with the support of coaching.
    - Then I will come back the focus to the participants to process their emotions and thinking in a way moving them forward the new way of living. At least helping them to identify where they are and what prevent them to live a higher life
    - Finally is a check in emotions, what they take away and their next step after the event.
