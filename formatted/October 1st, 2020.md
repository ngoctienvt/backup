- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) As today, I can feel that the coaching is effective due to the fact that I didn't start with what clients want to discuss, but rather explore to understand deeply first.
    - However, there are some moments that I feel I still explain too much instead of concise [reflection](<reflection.md>) and support clients to formulate their own [understanding](<understanding.md>).
    - I felt that I still in charge too much unnecessary. In fact, I want to support them to work on their own first, and only have some [stand back support](<stand back support.md>) to help them facilitate their development. [silence](<silence.md>)
- I noticed that I have a big desire to support other people to become better and that makes me want to share I know, what I find out to support them. But sometimes I focus too much on the process of sharing and forget the [end goal](<end goal.md>) are not sharing, but how helpful they are with them and how they can utilize it to become better. [helpful manner](<helpful manner.md>) [focus on what matters](<focus on what matters.md>)
- Today, I started to learn to [enjoy the process](<enjoy the process.md>) while I focus at the same time. It's the being while doing or being to do.
- I still feel a little mess to focus to working on [condensing and generative process](<condensing and generative process.md>). I need to be able to create a flow to condense things in a natural way. Now still a little bit too forcing and the mind still scatter in the process as it's not sure what it needs to do.
