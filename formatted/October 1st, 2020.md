- The [starting point](<starting point.md>) of everything is established a solidify [basic foundation](<basic foundation.md>) so that I can come back at any time. The role of a basic foundation is to establish a [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>), a broad viewpoint that includes things I want to work on. It would help to set me a [truth compass](<truth compass.md>) to come back when I feel lost or to expand myself based on the experience that I gained. [life flow](<life flow.md>) [progressive approach](<progressive approach.md>)
    - The reason to have a [starting point](<starting point.md>) is to realize that things have different levels or different progress to work on. [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>) The starting point is established by 
        - learning and getting used to what's possible, 
        - what's the floor and what's the possible ceiling?
        - what's the meaning of this?
    - After establishing a starting point, the next thing is about the [mastery](<mastery.md>) process. The process of mastery is what's I actually do in the [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>) that I defined. 
        - It's about listing the things that I want to master. The things to master will have different levels as well. 
            - One is to understand the components.
            - Second is to have a synthesis or a goal to use things together. [synthesis](<synthesis.md>)
        - Choose and go deep to acquire a [deeper understanding](<deeper understanding.md>) in each thing [[bottom-up approach
        - Synthesis things by a [top-down approach](<top-down approach.md>) that have goals, challenges, application oriented as a result.
        - Reflection after each learning to condense knowledges and experiences. [condensing and generative process](<condensing and generative process.md>)
    - The third step is going beyond.
        - Come back to the foundation and start to [[bottom-up approach things.
- [coaching reflection](<coaching reflection.md>) As today, I can feel that the coaching is effective due to the fact that I didn't start with what clients want to discuss, but rather explore to understand deeply first.
    - However, there are some moments that I feel I still explain too much instead of concise [reflection](<reflection.md>) and support clients to formulate their own [understanding](<understanding.md>).
    - I felt that I still in charge too much unnecessary. In fact, I want to support them to work on their own first, and only have some [stand back support](<stand back support.md>) to help them facilitate their development. [silence](<silence.md>)
- I noticed that I have a big desire to support other people to become better and that makes me want to share I know, what I find out to support them. But sometimes I focus too much on the process of sharing and forget the [end goal](<end goal.md>) are not sharing, but how helpful they are with them and how they can utilize it to become better. [helpful manner](<helpful manner.md>) [focus on what matters](<focus on what matters.md>)
- Today, I started to learn to [enjoy the process](<enjoy the process.md>) while I focus at the same time. It's the being while doing or being to do.
- I still feel a little mess to focus to working on [condensing and generative process](<condensing and generative process.md>). I need to be able to create a flow to condense things in a natural way. Now still a little bit too forcing and the mind still scatter in the process as it's not sure what it needs to do.
