- Today I just want to talk with [@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh](<@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh.md>) as two friends and not to solve anything, but to feel, to understand, and let her be herself. Let her feel seen, feel heard and feel understood, to be express her inner state, to share her life, to feel that's there is a person who always stand by her side unconditionally, always curious about her, and always want the best for her life unconditionally. It's not a reciprocal communication, but rather a deep connection between two souls to feel each other heart. [unconditional relationship](<unconditional relationship.md>)

- Let other people feel that's they are important. Let them feel seen, feel heard, and feel understood. [ðŸ§­Coaching MOC](<ðŸ§­Coaching MOC.md>) [unconditional relationship](<unconditional relationship.md>)

- It's been two long days for me to not release my inner thoughts. I noticed that I'm not able to love my parents unconditionally, there are many samskaras that I still haven't able to resolve yet. [unconditional relationship](<unconditional relationship.md>)
