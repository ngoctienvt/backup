- I felt that I started to have a new whole door to explore and to learn from. It excites me but overwhelms me at the same time. The reason is I still have a tendency to rush through, to have now,... I start to rush myself to that dopamine, rather than being center and let things unfold slowly in a [ðŸŒ²Bottom-up Emergence](<ðŸŒ²Bottom-up Emergence.md>).

    - My last week has been a week with new inspirations and directions. I started to feel that I will develop myself to become a thinker and a blogger to serve the world by my wisdom. I also find out something called [ðŸŒ±Instructional Design](<ðŸŒ±Instructional Design.md>) so that I could develop myself, and [learning facilitator](<learning facilitator.md>) to support other people learning effectively.
    - I noticed that my [ðŸŒ±Unshakable Centering](<ðŸŒ±Unshakable Centering.md>) is challenged because of many disturbances that emerge. I will spend most of my time today to work on this.

    - I can really feel that I'm becoming more and more clarity, more freedom, and much more cleaner inside. Even though sometimes I will lose myself, I still can easily get my center back. [ðŸŒ±Unshakable Centering](<ðŸŒ±Unshakable Centering.md>)
    - My feeling about time now is much slower, because I go through much more transformation in a short period of time, and it happens continuously, everything around me and inside me also change significantly without me even truly realizing how it has been changed.

- I wonder how I will handle my tag when I start to develop MOC and centralized notes. [ðŸŒ±Personal Knowledge Development cycle](<ðŸŒ±Personal Knowledge Development cycle.md>)

    - Who lights the stars last night?
Who shines the sun. x2 
To this one I gave my life, till my days as done.
To this one I gave my heart, till we merge as one.

- There are still many strong [samskaras](<samskaras.md>) that able to pull me out if I'm not aware of it. At least I can always notice them and keep melting them so they will become softer and softer over time. My [inner flow of energy](<inner flow of energy.md>) become cleaner over time.

- Today I just want to talk with [@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh](<@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh.md>) as two friends and not to solve anything, but to feel, to understand, and let her be herself. Let her feel seen, feel heard and feel understood, to be express her inner state, to share her life, to feel that's there is a person who always stand by her side unconditionally, always curious about her, and always want the best for her life unconditionally. It's not a reciprocal communication, but rather a deep connection between two souls to feel each other heart. [unconditional relationship](<unconditional relationship.md>)
