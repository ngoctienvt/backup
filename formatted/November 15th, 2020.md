- I felt that I started to have a new whole door to explore and to learn from. It excites me but overwhelms me at the same time. The reason is I still have a tendency to rush through, to have now,... I start to rush myself to that dopamine, rather than being center and let things unfold slowly in a [bottom-up approach](<bottom-up approach.md>). [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>)
- I noticed that I still need to work more on my [workflow](<workflow.md>), I still not clear what I need to do, so I just keep my mind wander and let it sink into the thoughts, emotions, and feelings. I'm not actively [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>) yet.
- My [point of focus](<point of focus.md>) is rather unclear, scatter, 
    - [ ] Learning to have a clarity mind and a clear point of focus will be one of my important task for next week [inner clarity](<inner clarity.md>)
- [weekly reflection](<weekly reflection.md>) 
    - My last week has been a week with new inspirations and directions. I started to feel that I will develop myself to become a thinker and a blogger to serve the world by my wisdom. I also find out something called [instructional design](<instructional design.md>) so that I could develop myself, and [learning facilitator](<learning facilitator.md>) to support other people learning effectively.
    - I noticed that my [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>) is challenged because of many disturbances that emerge. I will spend most of my time today to work on this.
    - [humility](<humility.md>), [true love](<true love.md>). [inner clarity](<inner clarity.md>) and [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>) are three quality that is my [point of focus](<point of focus.md>) currently.  
    - [workflow](<workflow.md>) [PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System MOC](<PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System MOC.md>) is my current focus of working, followed by [coaching](<coaching.md>).
    - I can really feel that I'm becoming more and more clarity, more freedom, and much more cleaner inside. Even though sometimes I will lose myself, I still can easily get my center back. [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>)
    - My feeling about time now is much slower, because I go through much more transformation in a short period of time, and it happens continuously, everything around me and inside me also change significantly without me even truly realizing how it has been changed. [time awareness](<time awareness.md>)
- I wonder how I will handle my tag when I start to develop MOC and centralized notes. [Personal Knowledge Development cycle](<Personal Knowledge Development cycle.md>)
- [Who lights the stars](<Who lights the stars.md>)
    - Who lights the stars last night?
Who shines the sun. x2 
To this one I gave my life, till my days as done.
To this one I gave my heart, till we merge as one.
    - Who lights the stars last night?
Who shines the sun. x2 
To this one I gave my life, till my days as done.
To this one I gave my heart, till we merge as one.
    - Who beats my heart
Who raise this one
Who lights the stars?
Who shines the sun
Who laid this one
- There are still many strong [samskaras](<samskaras.md>) that able to pull me out if I'm not aware of it. At least I can always notice them and keep melting them so they will become softer and softer over time. My [inner flow of energy](<inner flow of energy.md>) become cleaner over time.
