- Today I realized that I'm building my way from top to bottom. And this is not rigid, but rather a flexible system that will help me focus on my journey on earth.
    - Some will be rather fix on top as they are solidify end goals
    - However, the flexibility will increase when I'm coming down. And this is where I keep myself open but focus at the same time. This is where I struggle most.
