- Today I realized that I'm building my way from top to bottom. And this is not rigid, but rather a flexible system that will help me focus on my journey on earth.
    - Some will be rather fix on top as they are solidify end goals
    - However, the flexibility will increase when I'm coming down. And this is where I keep myself open but focus at the same time. This is where I struggle most.
- I feel so happy that the big picture of my life and how I will navigate through life is start to become clearer in front of me each day. It makes feel so much relieve and excite for future, because my foundation is become stronger and more grounded, so that's I could just go with ease, and just trust the process to happen. Because I can handle anything that will happen.
