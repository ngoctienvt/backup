- Today I realized that I'm building my way from top to bottom. And this is not rigid, but rather a flexible system that will help me focus on my journey on earth.
    - Some will be rather fix on top as they are solidify end goals
    - However, the flexibility will increase when I'm coming down. And this is where I keep myself open but focus at the same time. This is where I struggle most.
- I feel so happy that the big picture of my life and how I will navigate through life is start to become clearer in front of me each day. It makes feel so much relieve and excite for future, because my foundation is become stronger and more grounded, so that's I could just go with ease, and just trust the process to happen. Because I can handle anything that will happen. 
-  The How part is quite of a mess now, I will work on it tomorrow. The expect outcome is I can start to clear the fog, and put the priority in order.
- I have a little bit consider about using noun and verb. While noun is helpful for describe topic, it isn't helpful for provide direction and action. So if I use noun, it will need to be follow up with clear purpose and action.

If not, I will not have clarity in my head but rather keep the fog remain. [execution](<execution.md>)
- Today I learned that I'm very focus on what's the intention that we are giving on, but these pre-intentions are not the highest thing. The highest thing is always on people, not the process or what're given. [ðŸŒ±focus on what matters](<ðŸŒ±focus on what matters.md>). And what's effective in my belief is not need to attach and work on the situation, because the person who really need it will come to me that way naturally. The moment maybe is not need it yet. 
    - There is no best thing, but rather what serve the moment most based on my best effort is everything, not my pre-conceived ideas or methods.
        - Because the pre-given intention will be not cover everything, most of the time each moment will be different.
    - I also feel that I have judgement for people who are too much focus on the practices, or the techniques. [judgment](<judgment.md>)
    - My development is at the end, I will remove all of the techniques, let it merge inside of myself and present with each moments or each different situation to have the best what I could do to [raise the moments](<raise the moments.md>).
- I noticed that do like the script is easy, but work on out of script is like walking on the unknown. This is where I'm not sure about script anymore, but then I increase fear instead. [embrace the unknown](<embrace the unknown.md>)
