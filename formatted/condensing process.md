- The main meaning of [condensing process](<condensing process.md>) is to help you achieve [deeper understanding](<deeper understanding.md>) about the topics, concepts, so you can merge your scattering thoughts to a pearl of wisdom. 
    - This process is like a process of [pressure makes diamonds](<pressure makes diamonds.md>), and these diamonds are the materials for [condensing process](<condensing process.md>) or using into [real life application](<real life application.md>). 
- [ideal process](<ideal process.md>)
    - Flow
    - Feel intuitive and natural
    - Require less or no effort
- The ideal condense thought process:
    - I can start with freely copy, write, condense them slowly into higher thoughts. It's the same as a daily journal but more focus on the specific topic.
    - The condensing process is now little bit more [intentional](<intentional.md>) or [goal-driven](<goal-driven.md>), but not too much as [condensing process](<condensing process.md>). This is kind of a [pressure makes diamond](<pressure makes diamond.md>) process. Before actually using for a [real life application](<real life application.md>).
    - [condensing process](<condensing process.md>) will require a little bit of summarizing, key points, key understanding instead of lengthy writing. 
    - The information will be organized in a way that can edit or add-on later, or support [condensing process](<condensing process.md>) or support the next [condensing process](<condensing process.md>).
    - The structure is easy to edit from multiple thoughts into a structure thought.
    - The old dumping thoughts are still present, so actually copy makes it easier. I only need to use [Block Reference](<Block Reference.md>) for the one that got condensed already, so I can upgrade it over time.
- The condensing process:
    - Same as [accumulate thought process](<accumulate thought process.md>), but focus more on concepts, definitions, key ideas, usages,... Review and reread your related thoughts to get keywords or summarize of what you focus on in the [accumulate thought process](<accumulate thought process.md>).
    - Refined and repackage the thoughts into simple concepts, definitions, and remove unnecessary words. Changed from free-writing to concept-writing.
    - Repeat this process for any things that you want to deep dive to produce more and more little diamonds.

- The next step is I start to want to condense thoughts, and I'm not sure how I will start with. The reason is I feel that many thoughts that I write is only need some edit, so I don't want to write it again. [condensing process](<condensing process.md>)
