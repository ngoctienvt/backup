- Flow State will happen easier if
    - There is a clear clarity for execution instead of stopping for thinking
    - The tasks are challenged enough to maintain focus and engagement
    - The absence of distraction (internal and external)
    - The short-term built-in feedback loop for constant reflection
- [Conditions for flow](<Conditions for flow.md>)
    - [inner clarity](<inner clarity.md>)
        - knowing what to do next
        - knowing how to do it
        - one single type of task 
            - removing unnecessary tasks. For ex, if dumping thoughts then no need to care about grammar, wordings. 
        - Breakdown so they can finish in 1 go
        - Clarify outcomes and possible connections
    - stretch zone
        - high perceived challenge and high perceived skills
    - [distraction management](<distraction management.md>)
        - internal (thoughts, emotions, inner urges...)
        - external (phone, facebook, other people...)
        - maintain clarity
        - handle stress accumulation
    - short-term built-in feedback loop
        - clear and immediate
