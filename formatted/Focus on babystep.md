- Last week I felt that I started to have a new activity that is very helpful. It's about interactive lecture and discussion. This helps me to write more thoughts and do the next step externally, and let things unfold outside. It's much more helpful than I keep the big thing inside of my head, and feel too big to resolve. It's much better to write down for getting clarity and put everything on table, so it will not take my cognitive load. [Focus on babystep](<Focus on babystep.md>)
