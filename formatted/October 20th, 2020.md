- Instead of fearing and accepting below values, I would want to develop a [trueself competency](<trueself competency.md>) that is [conscientious dedication](<conscientious dedication.md>) (táº­n tÃ¢m táº­n lá»±c) to do the best and let things unfold instead of living a compromising life.
    - All [fear](<fear.md>) is only real when we aren't able to handle and to realize what's really us.
- What the soul wants is very different with what the ego wants. [Who's in charge my life?](<Who's in charge my life?.md>) [high intention](<high intention.md>)
- I felt so much [refreshing](<refreshing.md>) after doing my yoga routine. I also learnt a lot of new things in the process of practising it.

    - The [ego-guidance](<ego-guidance.md>) will base its ideas from separation, reaction, samskaras, the inner-disturbance, the past, results-oriented.
    - The [soul-guidance](<soul-guidance.md>) will base on the [integration](<integration.md>), [generating languages](<generating languages.md>), [being mode](<being mode.md>), natural flow-oriented - [ðŸŒ±Natural Progression](<ðŸŒ±Natural Progression.md>).
- We are so misunderstood about the definition of what is normal, we are live in the unhealthy state of being, behaviors, choices but we believe they are normal. [true normal](<true normal.md>) need to be seen or else we will have no reason to cure ourselves.
    - In order to truly know what is normal, we need to know what is it and what is the method to find out what's normal?
