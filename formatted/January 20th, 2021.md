- My today focus
    - Working next about the knowledge organization
        - Draw by layers - ƒë·ªì h·ªça ch·ªìng l·ªõp
- I started to realize that I'm learning to use my life end goals as a way to help me let go all of my personal needs while keeping me doing the right thing as the same time.
    - That's why it's very important to learn how to include other things and clarify it, as well as the relationship of it to my current stages, because it will act as a thing that I need to aim for, while I'm being seduced by the short-term satisfaction.
    - I need to develop an [alignment](<alignment.md>) between now and between where I want to become, so that I will not derail myself out of the part unconsciously.
        - Like I need to have a clear picture about how my romatic love relationship should be, so that I need to correct myself into that direction, even if it's hard. Because if I'm not clear about it, I will be easy to be distract and derail, and at the same time, reinforce myself to be easier to aim myself in the wrong direction.
            - The main reasion is what I truly want is not clear, but what clear is what interested to give me short-term satisfaction now.
        - My whole life need to be redefine and not act based on [short-term pleasure](<short-term pleasure.md>) but rather something higher than that, and this thing need to be reinforce and clear so that it will help me overcome the pull of short-term pleasure.
            - One of the thing I could think about now is developing a deeper satisfaction between the current me and the one I want to become, and reinforce this deep satisfaction. When I manage to do this, it will act as a path to bring me out of the self-distracting stage now. [true satisfaction](<true satisfaction.md>)
                - [true satisfaction](<true satisfaction.md>) is something that connect between me, my growth, and reality.
                - [short-term pleasure](<short-term pleasure.md>) is something that I am be pulled by the pull of my lower-self which I should be handle to grow, rather than listen to it instead.
                - Without the clear picture about something that I want to achieve based on me - not my lower-self, I will be confuse when I'm acting based on what I truly want or acting based on being pulled.
- I also noticed that I hate to see something that's not logical but I feel that it's intentional to manipulate my feelings rather than let it happens naturally. I don't like the feeling of being manipulate, and I have a quite strong resistance to it.
- I also have a tendency to look back and regret, rather than focus on now, and possibilities for the future.
- It's seem like that it's better to complete the whole session rather than seeing the half-part, so I will temporarily hold today work on coaching session for tomorrow.
- Today I will work more on the end goal that left not process next week.
    - Today work remind me that it's important to work straight to the end and work on that backwards. It's also important to skip what I think should be happen, so that it removed unneccessary thoughts and beliefs.
    - My goal for the [üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth](<üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth.md>) is about helping other people to
        - Know what they truly want in their life
        - Create their own way or system to consistently reach to their life end goals
        - Integrate it into their daily life
    - In order to support other people to able to do this, I need to manage to do it in my life first as I will be the one who examine the effectiveness of my approach. And it will also help me to develop my true competencies for this way of living life.
- There are many samskaras and thoughts that I need to let go as I notice I still have a strong tendency to control life and people that stimulate me in the wrong way.
- I also need to learn to connect deeper with other people and edit my way of thinking properly to match with that connection.
- [Surrend to the truth of the world](<Surrend to the truth of the world.md>)
    - I noticed that my perceptions has always distort and deduct the world to fit the mind. But it‚Äôs not the truth. It‚Äôs just reinforce me to my wrong way of thinking.
    - In this new stage of life, I will learn to redirect my whole way of thinking to base on the truth of the world, not how I want to interpret it, so it makes me feel better.
    - It‚Äôs about learning to truly surrend myself to the moments in front of me, they are not created by me, I have no right to control it. And it shouldn‚Äôt as my will but rather happen as how it should happen by itself. And my job is learning to have a healthy harmony relationship with it.

- [What it means to be a develop soul](<What it means to be a develop soul.md>) and [What it means to be a develop human being](<What it means to be a develop human being.md>) will be 2 big questions that could help me to clarify the way I want to navigate in life.
