- I noticed that I'm climbing and I will need to have a staircase to help me climb. But I know that at the end, I will need to release the staircase as well, but it's necessary to help me to reach where I want to be.
    - I will need to use the staircase many times until I can finally stable in the place. And by learning to climb, I can help other people create their own staircase as well.
    - However, it's a little tough for me now because the staircase is not fully clear yet. I still kind of hang in the air without not so sure about the end. This lead to my actions a little bit hesistant and still not fluent.
