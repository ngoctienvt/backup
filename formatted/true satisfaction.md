- I felt quite hot when meditation but actually I can felt that I become better over time when I'm keep relax and release. I also noticed that at least I want to learn to enjoy [unattachment centering](<unattachment centering.md>) over anything else. It's hard, it's challenging, and it requires me to use my own will power to keep myself detach with my mind and my emotions, but I can se that it's a highest thing that I can do for myself, and there is no cost, no time, no loss, just benefits, sustainable benefits.
