- The difference between coaching and yoga in supporting other people in their transformational journey is
    - Yoga gives people the method, the preparation needed and point to the end destination, and let people go through the journey to comeback by themselves
    - Coaching is not focus so much on the end, on the top of the mountain. But rather mainly focus on supporting a person go through their change, elevate the hidden potential at the moment, nurture the inner seed that yearn to be shine. And a person will have many breakthrough throughout their lifetime to completely shine. 
    - So coaching is more about supporting the journey and facilitating the breakthrough process by amplifying the inner potential, rather than giving the destination and the things to self-navigate.
