- [üìùWeekly Review](<üìùWeekly Review.md>)
    - Highlights:
        - Doing a sharing workshop about The surrender experiment and seeing people having new awareness. Feeling peaceful when doing the workshop.
        - Completing the structure of the group coaching program
        - Deepening insights by re-watching Living from the place of surrender 
        - Feeling more unattachments with outcomes
    - Lowlights:
        - Noticing that I seem like trying to make the relationship happen
        - Thinking too much about the program 
        - Still feel restlessness while doing the program
    - Next week
        - Continue letting go of myself and let life reveal itself to me - more lean back
        - Let life energy bring me to do the needed work
- I start to see the relevance between Coaching and Spiritual development - this will be a big major development for the next time as these 2 worlds seem to able to collapse and merge to each other.
    - The reason is because I see that it's important to point out what's wrong inside, and how we are compensate it with external things. Then we don't have to choose to solve 1 thing and neglect other, but can take care both.
