- [[ðŸŒ±One Step Planning]] It's good to break the steps and the work down. However, there are still some wandering questions and uncomfortable feeling in me. It's about what if you don't know how to do it yet? Then we will feel certain restraints and procrastination. How to overcome this and complete the tasks?
    - One is I could meditate about the tasks to know how to do it
    - Second is I could create a process will help me go through it, it will help me to know how to do, then do it
    - This is starting to invole into the How part, when Why we do, and What we need to do is clear
- I start to see that my life is becoming settle more and more and the structure start to emerge and establish. The flow is not there yet, but it's moving in the right direction.
- The reason why I want to ask [[@Nguyá»…n Má»¹ Linh]] to support me is because I can feel her potential to do the job that's not in my strength, so that I can do what I'm good at instead. 
    - It didn't matter if we will become a couple or not, I will learn to let go all of my personal feelings, so that I can direct myself to serve the world, and cooperate with other people to serve together.
- [[ðŸŒ±My way of thinking]]
    - There will some main aspects for my new way of thinking
        - [[generative language]] My language will mainly focus on enable the merge and growth process. 
            - It will focus to support inclusion rather exclusion, removing the suffering rather than creating the suffering.
            - Focus on nurturing growth rather than change and solve problems
        - My way of seeing life will change from future and past into now and the process that are happening, and not attach to any things
        - Have a clear direction about how I want to become, and what I want to achieve, so that I could focus to work on it
        - Developing compassion and understanding for the things that I haven't able to handle and still disturbed me so much yet
- [[My Life Polestar]]
    - My purpose now is transcending my personal self and freeing me out of my personal thoughts, needs, feelings, beliefs...
    - Second is learning to unfold my potentials to serve the world in an impersonal way
    - Third is learning to enjoy life in every single second no matter what and no matter reason 
- [[ðŸŒ±My Uniqueness]]
    - I'm not so sure about my uniqueness yet. But I can see some are
        - I have the ability and tendency to improve and make things better
        - I have the ability to bring right understanding and explaining them in a coherent way together, rather than just let them work as beliefs or stories
        - I have the strong resistance to stop me to do what I'm not believing in and not feel rights. 
        - I have the ability to see the big pictures, the concepts, the generalizations, and develope process to do things
        - I have strong needs for clarify things instead of letting them remain as concepts or general explanations without clear understanding.
