- Raw data
    - **Hierarchies **are inherently ‚Äútop-down,‚Äù in that they are designed to enable **centralized control** from a single, privileged position. [[hierarchy]]
        - Hierarchies are effective for large-scale, slow-moving efforts in relatively predictable environments. [[predictable environments]]
        - They enable centralized direction and tight synchronization between many moving parts. [[centralized direction]]
        - For example, in times of command and control warfare, mass producing a standardized product, or managing a vast bureaucracy, only a hierarchy will work.
    - Networks are inherently ‚Äúbottom-up,‚Äù in that the structure emerges organically from small interactions without direction from a central authority. [[network]]
        - Networks are good in small-scale, quickly changing situations in unpredictable environments. [[flexible environments]]
    - Self-organization overcomes formal organizing‚Äôs rigidity. Formal organization keeps at bay self-organization‚Äôs tendency to self-destruct. [[self-organization]]
    - Francis Bacon‚Äôs scientific method, first introduced in the 17th century, was a bottom-up, networked approach to building scientific understanding. [[üå≤Bottom-up Approach]] [[network approach]]
    - In the 18th century, the encyclopedia movement promoted most famously by Denis Diderot moved in the opposite direction. [[üå≤Top-down Approach]]
    - Memory searching
        - Searching relies on declarative memory ‚Äì remembering and entering the precise contents of a file ‚Äì which is a higher-level brain function that consumes a lot of energy.
        - Searching relies on declarative memory ‚Äì remembering and entering the precise contents of a file ‚Äì which is a higher-level brain function that consumes a lot of energy. [[declarative memory]]
        - Manual navigation, on the other hand, relies on procedural memory. This kind of memory uses ‚Äúolder‚Äù parts of the brain that developed to navigate spatial environments, and thus comes to us more naturally. [[procedural memory]]
    - Complementing [[complement]] [[üå±Progressive Development Approach]]
        - But the **weakness of hierarchical systems** is that **knowledge remains siloed** from other ideas that could spark interesting connections.
        - **Adding a network** to our file systems can help us **preserve the benefits of hierarchy**, while infusing it with **cross-connections and associations.** Thinking of tags as ‚Äútunnels‚Äù through our knowledge connection allows us to make use of our rich understanding of humans‚Äô relationship to physical space.
            - Tunnels have a beginning and an end, a top and a bottom. We are comfortable navigating tunnels.
    - [[Tag usage]]
        - Tagging notes across different notebooks allows us to **perceive cross-disciplinary themes and patterns** that defy simple categorization. [[inter-related]]
            - Tagging all the notes we want to review for a project could make our choices easier, by **creating a boundary** around the information we‚Äôll consider before taking action. [[üå≤Top-down Approach]]
            - And tagging notes according to which stage of a project they are best suited for can improve our thinking by allowing us to focus on only the most relevant information for the given moment. [[horizons of focus]]
            - With the simple act of assigning labels to things, we invite the brain‚Äôs pattern recognition ability to identify their similarities and thereby predict what other items would fit the label too. [[relevant progressing]]
            - We shape the environment, and then the environment shapes our mind.
    - [[Information mapping]] ‚Äì tagging for the knowledge lifecycle
    - I believe that what is needed for tagging to fulfill its potential while remaining feasible is to change its function:
        - from labeling the ‚Äúconceptual meaning‚Äù of bits of information to tracking life cycle
    - I believe that what is needed for tagging to fulfil its potential while remaining feasible is to change its function: [[knowledge lifecycle]]
        - Identifying knowledge
        - Capturing knowledge
        - Verifying knowledge
        - Interpreting knowledge
        - Organizing knowledge
        - Categorizing knowledge
        - Disseminating knowledge
        - Combining knowledge
        - Creating knowledge
        - Using knowledge
        - Re-evaluating knowledge
    - The products of creativity are constantly evolving and in flux, but the creative process is ancient and unchanging.
    - [[project lifecycle]] methodology
        - Initial learning
        - Relearning or review
        - Reference
        - Briefing and browsing
        - Updating with changes
        - Using as job aids
    - ‚Äú[[information block]]‚Äù ‚Äì organizing knowledge into **standardized ‚Äúchunks‚Äù **that could be mixed and matched to suit a specific need.
        - Unstructured information was ‚Äúclustered‚Äù into information blocks with clear labels, which were linked together and further refined in the writing process. [[connection thinking]] [[compressed process]]
    - [[Information mapping]] was an important step toward ‚ÄúJust-in-Time Learning.‚Äù
        - Instead of giving readers a massive text and expecting them to hold it all in their mind
        - the best use for labels is as an [[output mechanism]], not an input mechanism.
    - two very different [[functions of information]]
        - ‚Äì learning and reference ‚Äì
        - and should be retrieved quickly and efficiently just as it was needed.
    - By labeling our notes when they are being used, instead of when they are created, we move the work of tagging as close as possible to the problem it is meant to solve. [[closing the gap]] [[moving forward]]
