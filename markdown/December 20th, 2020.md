- I wamt to create 3 big courses
    - One course is about training other people to become a compentent coach so that they can serve other people through coaching. [[Training Course - Master the Art of Coaching]]
    - One course is about personal development which is about helping other people to build their foundation for self-development [[ðŸŒ±Training Course - Effortless Growth]]
    - One course is about self-realization, about understanding the reality and about living harmony with world, and become the blessing on the world. [[Training Course - Living from the place of surrender]]
    - That's all. I just need to focus to become an expert or master on these 3 areas and build my course around this.
    - I will built them on a way that it's how I want a people gone through my funnel training. 
        - The first one will be [[ðŸŒ±Training Course - Effortless Growth]], because it will act as a strong foundation for people to learn better, self-motivate themselves on right direction, and have a system for sustainable self-development.
            - My growth now is quite good, but it's rather spontaneous and broad, and the focus is blurry. I'm lacking the element of focus.
        - After that, [[Training Course - Living from the place of surrender]] will be for supporting other people to realize who they truly are, what the world truly is, and what life should really be. This will awake them and make them start to nurture their being in a truly right way.
        - Finally, for people who are yearn to support other in the deepest and personal way, [[Training Course - Master the Art of Coaching]] is for them. When they already who they are, know what they want, and able to listen to their inner knowing, it will reduce the chance that's they come to coach training for personal growth, but rather for what it's really means. -> Create people who want to support other people in a deepest and personal way.
