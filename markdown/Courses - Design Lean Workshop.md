        - Purpose of session 1: 
            - get used to know each other
            - get used to tools - Jamboard and Zoom

        - How sesion flow
            - While You Wait activities
            - Getting used to Jamboard activities
                - Purpose
                    - Gain-attention activity to help ice-breaking [[gain-attention]]
                    - Interact to each other 
                    - Ensure everyone can use tools
                    - Help students learn to use different features of tools through activities

                - This is an indirect activities to introduce facilitators. It reduces one-way interaction

            - What is the similarities between design a workshop and design a house?
                - Grouping
                - Request to gather to only 3 visible similarities
                    - It requires students to think in higher level (understand, compare, a bit of analytic and evaluate)
                - Metaphor question is to help guide students start to think about design a workshop - guided thinking
                    - If students are required to discuss steps to design a workshop, the gap of thinking will be too big.
                    - Start with level understand and compare first.
                - These activities are [[guided thinking]] activities to help students level up their thinking slowly
            - 5 steps to design a workshop activity
                - Group people to 4 groups, discuss and summarize 5 steps to design a workshop
                - [[steps activities]]
                    - Request students to list specific number of steps to complete certain tasks based on students' own experience.
                - For content that have process and steps, this activity help to survey how everyone is doing.
                - Purpose
                    - Survey the level of students
                    - Bring out a standard process
                - Everyone will group what discussed to become 5 steps and introduce steps if neccessary.
                - Grouping again to discuss more details on each step
                    - Note:
                        - For big group, a limit number of step is helpful to focus 
                        - For small group, number of step could be flexible for creativity
                - These steps can be teach one-way very fast, but there will lack of interaction, and students will feel hard to understand and remember.
                    - By interacting and creating their own content, they will remember better.
                    - This is called "[[generative-instructional strategy]]" instead of [[supplantive-instructional strategy]]".
                        - [[Flow model]]
                            - Balance between provide knowledge and guidance practices
                            - ![Csikszentmihalyi’s 3-channel flow model ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jon_Pearce/publication/251772214/figure/fig1/AS:298183650496516@1448103930761/Csikszentmihalyis-3-channel-flow-model.png)
            - Write down questions to dig deep activity

                - Number of questions are 5 and group into steps of design a wokshop
                    - This is a analytic thinking level
                - The way to link activities are 
                    - results of above activities are input or foundation the next activities.

            - Completing sentences acitivities
                - Completing 2 sentences in group chat
                    - Today I feel...
                    - In this program, I will focus on... to...
                - Purpose
                    - It helps participants to focus into what's matter and valuable
        - Overall note
            - A online workshop will require more interactions than offline workshop, because participants will be distract easier.
            - The process to survey needs will not only occur before, but inside the activities of workshop
                - This is call "hidden agenda" of that activity
            - Design a workshop should have some backup activities if there is enough time.
