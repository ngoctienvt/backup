        - Purpose of session 1: 
            - get used to know each other
            - get used to tools - Jamboard and Zoom
            - doing activities to have a big picture about design workshop and survey student needs
        - How sesion flow
            - While You Wait activities
            - Getting used to Jamboard activities
                - Purpose
                    - Gain-attention activity to help ice-breaking [[gain-attention]]
                    - Interact to each other 
                    - Ensure everyone can use tools
                    - Help students learn to use different features of tools through activities
                        - For example
                            - Getting used to create sticky notes
                            - Getting used to interact with each other on a Jamboard page
                            - Getting used to workshop and keywords
            - Introduce yourself and get to know facilitators activities
                - This is an indirect activities to introduce facilitators. It reduces one-way interaction
                - Grouping to different people to have a narrow and deeper interaction to each other
            - What is the similarities between design a workshop and design a house?
                - Grouping
                - Request to gather to only 3 visible similarities
                    - It requires students to think in higher level (understand, compare, a bit of analytic and evaluate)
                - Metaphor question is to help guide students start to think about design a workshop - guided thinking
                    - If students are required to discuss steps to design a workshop, the gap of thinking will be too big.
                    - Start with level understand and compare first.
                - These activities are [[guided thinking]] activities to help students level up their thinking slowly
            - 5 steps to design a workshop activity
                - Group people to 4 groups, discuss and summarize 5 steps to design a workshop
                - [[steps activities]]
                    - Request students to list specific number of steps to complete certain tasks based on students' own experience.
                - For content that have process and steps, this activity help to survey how everyone is doing.
                - Purpose
                    - Survey the level of students
                    - Bring out a standard process
                - Everyone will group what discussed to become 5 steps and introduce steps if neccessary.
                - Grouping again to discuss more details on each step
                    - Note:
                        - For big group, a limit number of step is helpful to focus 
                        - For small group, number of step could be flexible for creativity
                - These steps can be teach one-way very fast, but there will lack of interaction, and students will feel hard to understand and remember.
                    - By interacting and creating their own content, they will remember better.
                    - This is called "[[generative-instructional strategy]]" instead of [[supplantive-instructional strategy]]".
                        - [[Flow model]]
                            - Balance between provide knowledge and guidance practices
                            - ![Csikszentmihalyi’s 3-channel flow model ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jon_Pearce/publication/251772214/figure/fig1/AS:298183650496516@1448103930761/Csikszentmihalyis-3-channel-flow-model.png)
            - Write down questions to dig deep activity
                - An activity to help students guide their learning process
                    - It's a need survey and evaluate right from the beginning.
                    - From these questions, facilitators can adjust program properly, and help students prime their mind to focus.
                - Number of questions are 5 and group into steps of design a wokshop
                    - This is a analytic thinking level
                - The way to link activities are 
                    - results of above activities are input or foundation the next activities.
            - What principles needed for a workshop activity
                - Listing and choosing activities
            - Introduce workshop activity
                - It's not necessary to introduce the program at the beginning.
                - It should be introduce when participants have some knowledge about the program.
            - Completing sentences acitivities
                - Completing 2 sentences in group chat
                    - Today I feel...
                    - In this program, I will focus on... to...
                - Purpose
                    - It helps participants to focus into what's matter and valuable
        - Overall note
            - A online workshop will require more interactions than offline workshop, because participants will be distract easier.
            - The process to survey needs will not only occur before, but inside the activities of workshop
                - This is call "hidden agenda" of that activity
            - Design a workshop should have some backup activities if there is enough time.
- Session 2 - Identify goal of a workshop

        - https://jamboard.google.com/d/1XR-dnZ1L_VqcMQgZR9f6Ch7isSpXQbcnK6zSLxRvASM/edit?usp=sharing
        - Tasks analysis is list down everything a person need to do to complete a major goal, in a reality scenario - not classom. 
            - The list down process will focus on the participant, not focus on what the trainer will teach.
        - "Boil egg" activities
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BV5EMnpXf7cVWR3gdm9NMgUIby1XNxMYOUoDjAVQULA/edit?usp=sharing
            - 6- Boil egg activities - demo activites
                - Use pictures to let participants choice, so that they will have a feeling of free-choice and will more engage.
                - Do together with everyone, and emphasizes what need to care when doing tasks analysis
                - This type of demo activities will bring people to situation, and have their own learning in different aspects of activities.
                    - Main lesson for tasks analysis
                        - Simple task in head because we did it doesn't mean it simple to describe details for another person who know nothing about it
                        - If the goal and the target participant is not clear, tasks analysis will be very complicated
        - [[Opening activities]]
            - Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM6B0k3E25I&ab_channel=ConnectionCoach
                - Benefits of video:
                    - Stimulate the emotions of participants, so it helps to lead to lessons
                    - Put participants into a specific situation, so it helps to lead to the situation that facilitator want students focus on.
                    - Deliver information by stories which help students to remember easier
                    - These benefits are not apply for "how-to" video, but for situation video.
                - "Share 2 outstanding emotions of two children"
                    - With activities have emotion involve, harvest emotions immediately will help students learn.
                        - For examples, an activity that require participants to choose 2 emotions from a list of emotions.
                - "What dad want to teach the children?"
                    - After havest emotions, this is a step to harvest the lesson in that situation of the video.
                    - If ask this question immediately after watch Video, participants can feel confuse, because their mind still focus on the video and the emotions emerge.
                - "How to apply the lesson to design a workshop?"
                    - After harvest lesson based on the situation of the activity, this step is about link to real life situation.
                - The step to harvest an emotional activities
                    - Do activities
                    - Harvest emotions
                    - Harvest lessons in the situation of the activities
                    - Expanded learning to real life situation
        - Fill into space to define "Tasks analysis" process
            - This step to define definition will help people start to think about it as "know" level
            - 
        - 7- Điền vào chỗ trống để định nghĩa quá trình "phân tích nhiệm vụ"

Trước khi yêu cầu mọi người phân tích sâu hơn về quá trình này, thì bước định nghĩa này giúp mọi người bắt đầu tư duy về nó, ở tầng "biết" nó là gì. Buổi sắp tới, tụi mình sẽ cùng mọi người đi qua các bậc tư duy này, và mọi người sẽ hiểu tại sao chúng ta phải dẫn dắt người học qua từng bậc tư duy một cách từ từ, thay vì nhảy ngay lập tức lên bậc cao.
        - What should/ shouldn't do when doing tasks analysis
            - Harvest activities for "boil egg" activities
            - Help people grab the tasks analysis process and its principle
            - It requires people to analyze and evaluate what they just gone through.
        - 8- Những điều nên làm / không nên làm trong quá trình phân tích nhiệm vụ (task analysis) là gì?

Đây là thu hoạch cho hoạt động demo "Luộc trứng" nói trên. Mục đích của hoạt động demo là để cho mọi người nắm được quá trình phân tích nhiệm vụ và các nguyên lý của nó. Phần này để thu hoạch cho phần "nguyên lý", nó yêu cầu mọi người phân tích và đánh giá những gì mình vừa trải qua.
        - Project-based learning 
            - People will execute a small project for them
            - The project in this case is a goal of workshop of 3 students
            - Facilitators also need to attend to the process
                - This is called "scaffolding" - helping process.
                    - Facilitator will support direct by involve and ask questions (high support level). 
                    - Then reduce over time and only involve when necessary. 
                    - At the end, the support will reduce to lowest so that students can complete by themselves.
        - 9- Bốn (04) bước để phân tích nhiệm vụ (task analysis) là gì?

Đây là thu hoạch cho "quá trình phân tích nhiệm vụ". Dạng hoạt động này đã được thực hiện trong các buổi học trước rồi.
        - Harvest after practices
            - This is important after demo, practice, or an activities that have "aha moments".
        - Summarize by "Square, Circle, Triangle" activities

        - Design objectives (thiết kế nội dung) are listing knowledge or information that participant need to be able to complete the tasks.
            - Results are list of knowledge or information that need to teach.
        - Đánh giá 
            - tự phân tích đưa ra được đặc điểm của bản thân
            - kiểm chứng đặc điểm của người khác
        - Task là hoạt động cần làm. Objective là hiểu biết nội tại cần thiết để làm được hoạt động.
            - Task là outcome cần, objective là kiến thức để làm được outcome.
            - Task trước, outcome sau.
            - Reality đi trước, không phải personal needs

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FNgoctien%2FkZTItUDPQy.png?alt=media&token=4f6754d1-d64d-4e93-9ff6-04c2d7360937)
        - 
    - Những điều người học cần biết để làm được điều này là gì?
    - Kiến thức này sẽ giúp họ làm được điều gì?
    - Tasks analysis is listing all of steps a person need to do to complete big goal in real life situation, not classrom situation.
    - Objective analysis is look at classrom situation, and analyze what a person will go through and resolve in the class to complete tasks.
    - The objective of session 5 is let participants design the contents for workshop.
        - Using poll to look back where we are - 
            - This kind of fast question is Interactive Lecture activities. It helps people focus on content and keyword, and increase their thinking level from "know" to "understand" or "analyze.
        - Learning about Bloom's taxonomy
            - Card Sort -> know
            - Example on "boil egg" activities as illustration for each level. -> from know to understand
            - Demo "luộc khoai" -> bring Bloom to a specific context -> easier to understand and apply
            -  Test "understand" level before going to "apply"
                - Definition testing
                    - Objectives design is a process to identify the information a person need to know to be able to complete the tasks.
                    - The results of objectives design is the knowledge that need to teach on the program.
            - "Boil egg" group activities 
                - "Apply" what "understand" in the pre-given context to similar context.
        - The difference between "tasks" and "objective" - analyze level
        - What "should" and "shouldn't on objective design - evaluate level. Creating level will be for personal exercises.
        - Using message "keep kitchen clean" to lead to another knowledge [[Krathwohl’s Affective Taxonomy]].
            - Write down all of ways to deliver the above message. 
        - Another card sort to **know **about [[Krathwohl’s Affective Taxonomy]]
            - Example from "boil egg" to **understand**
            - What are expressions coressponding to Affective level about "Workshop online still have effective interaction"? - hidden agenda - Let prople bring up by themselves
        - Summarize: choose and complete 3 sentences regard to 3 stage of Bloom
        - The sequences of activites are to help people level up their level of thinking, if they are already level up before the activities happen, then that activities are not needed anymore.
