                - Grouping
                - Request to gather to only 3 visible similarities
                    - It requires students to think in higher level (understand, compare, a bit of analytic and evaluate)
                - Metaphor question is to help guide students start to think about design a workshop - guided thinking
                    - If students are required to discuss steps to design a workshop, the gap of thinking will be too big.
                    - Start with level understand and compare first.
                - These activities are [[guided thinking]] activities to help students level up their thinking slowly
            - 5 steps to design a workshop activity
                - Group people to 4 groups, discuss and summarize 5 steps to design a workshop
                - [[steps activities]]
                    - Request students to list specific number of steps to complete certain tasks based on students' own experience.

                    - Bring out a standard process
                - Everyone will group what discussed to become 5 steps and introduce steps if neccessary.
                - Grouping again to discuss more details on each step
                    - Note:
                        - For big group, a limit number of step is helpful to focus 
                        - For small group, number of step could be flexible for creativity
                - These steps can be teach one-way very fast, but there will lack of interaction, and students will feel hard to understand and remember.
                    - By interacting and creating their own content, they will remember better.
                    - This is called "[[generative-instructional strategy]]" instead of [[supplantive-instructional strategy]]".
