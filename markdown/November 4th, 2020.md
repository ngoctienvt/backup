- It feels quite uncomfortable and not natural to clean up the bottom-up approach. [[Expanding questions]]
    - I'm not totally clear about what I could generalize to capture [[entirety of an atomic concept]] [[generalization]] [[contextual usages]]
    - How I will clean what's not the main point? [[Roam's writing structure]]
        - Should I come to the main point and clean it now? or
        - Should I just remove the link, so it will clean on this bottom-up approach page?
        - What should be my way to structure my daily note writing, 
            - so that the inbox will SHOW what the thoughts truly about, 
            - and how should I tag things intentionally, so that's they will not cluster page?
            - What's the reason for me to tag freely before?
- I'm on a [[transition stage]] that shift myself from the imposing structure of social to comeback to [[unattachment centering]] so that I could operate in a way that true harmony with reality, not society.
- [[my quotes]]
[[true harmony]] is the harmony between our true self and reality, not the ego self and society.
- My [[mindset]] is now from the higher-self and the rest of the lower-self. 
    - For example, grateful and ungrateful. Love and no love, Respect and unrespect. There is no need to care the differences of lower-self. Just need to know it is lower-self to aim to higher-self. [[indifferentiated]]
- I noticed that if I want to tag something, it could not be my free-thoughts, but rather the [[high-value information blocks that got process a bit and want to process more. [[Tag usage]]
- I feel much better when starting processing bottom-up approach to learn about my [[compressed process]]
    - Key takeaways::
        - Some [[types of information block]] that I started to see when processing bottom-up approach concepts are
            - real life application
            - definition
            - benefits 
            - characteristics
            - procedure
- {{[[TODO]]}} working on workflow process again

- [[types of blog]]
    - digital garden
    - flourish-content blog

- [[threaded thinking]] instead of [[linear thinking]]
    - Thinking is not only non-linear, it's messy. It involves a lot of back and forth, dead ends, branching, walking back, merging ideas, changing ideas, contradicting ideas. When I picture what my thoughts look like—the actual process of navigating different ideas in my head—I don't see a nice straight road with check points, I see a massive web of tangled threads.
    -  The ideal tool for thought would embrace the messiness of our minds, and organically help insights emerge from chaos instead of forcing an artificial order. [[condition for emergence]]
