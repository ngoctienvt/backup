- It feels quite uncomfortable and not natural to clean up the [[bottom-up approach]]. The reason is
    - I'm not totally clear about what I could generalize to capture [[entirety of an atomic concept]] [[generalization]] [[contextual usages]]
    - How I will clean what's not the main point? [[Roam's writing structure]]
        - Should I come to the main point and clean it now? or
        - Should I just remove the link, so it will clean on this bottom-up approach page?
        - What should be my way to structure my daily note writing, 
            - so that the inbox will SHOW what the thoughts truly about, 
            - and how should I tag things intentionally, so that's they will not cluster page?
            - What's the reason for me to tag freely before?
    - What woul be my [[workflow]] for daily notes and seek clarity for what I'm working on?

    - # 1. The Monastic Strategy
        - The Monastic philosophy has one basic principle: **cut all shallow activities to focus on deep work.**“This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations”
        - People who follow the Monastic strategy abolish any extra work not related to their main projects. This means weeks or months without answering emails or doing paperwork.
    - # Who Should Use the Monastic Deep Work Strategy?
        - People who work in fields in which success is **strictly tied** to the **quality** and **quantity** of the output.
        - **Pros**
            - Best for maximizing output
            - Removes work that brings small results
        - **Cons**
            - Not an option for most careers
            - Neglects new opportunities that may arise
    - # Schedule Example of the Monastic Strategy
        - The main rule of this strategy is to eliminate unnecessary shallow work.
        - The ultimate goal is to **spend as much time in a state of deep focus** on your most meaningful projects.
    - # 2. The Bimodal Strategy
        - Followers of the Bimodal philosophy **split their schedule according to the depth of work**.
        - They plan large, uninterrupted time blocks of deep work where they work like a monastic. When this period is over, they only deal with shallow work.
        - “This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else.”
        - The size of the Deep Work blocks can range from months to days. However, one day per week is the minimum.
    - # Who Should Use the Bimodal Deep Work Strategy?
        - Individuals with **well-defined and valuable goals **are the most common users of the strategy.
        - **Pros**
            - Large quantities of deep work with schedule flexibility
            - Great for projects that need long days of uninterrupted concentration
        - **Cons**
            - Not as productive as the monastic philosophy
            - Still difficult to integrate with most knowledge jobs
    - # Schedule Example of the Bimodal Strategy
        - The bimodal philosophy can be implemented on a monthly or a weekly basis.
        - On a weekly basis, you can **block Mondays and Fridays** to solely focus on deep work. If possible, try to include more days.
    - # 3. The Rhythmic Strategy
        - “This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.”
    - # Who Should Use the Rhythmic Deep Work Strategy?
        - The flexibility of this strategy allows for most knowledge workers to use it. Some examples include university professors, consultants, and lawyers.
        - You only need **consistent and uninterrupted ****time blocks** each day to use the rhythmic strategy.
        - **Pros**
            - Very easy to implement in a normal schedule
            - Habit-based, increasing the chance of Deep Work completion
        - **Cons**
            - Not optimal for tackling big projects quickly
            - Takes time and mental energy to switch from shallow work to Deep Work
    - # 4. The Journalistic Strategy
        - The main idea of the journalistic philosophy is to **fit Deep Work whenever possible**.
        - If you do not have any obligations to meet at the moment, use the extra time to tackle Deep Work. Instead of glazing over your emails, make progress in your projects.
    - # How to Use Journalistic Deep Work Strategy
        - This strategy is reserved for people with lots of experience in Deep Work.
        - Users of this strategy need two crucial attributes:
            - The ability to switch between shallow work and Deep Work quickly
            - Confidence in their abilities
        - **Pros**
            - Great for unpredictable schedules
            - Time-efficient
        - **Cons**
            - Very difficult to replicate
            - Requires a lot of deep work experience
    - # Schedule Example of the Journalistic Strategy
        - Given that it is the most unpredictable, the example is also the least insightful.
        - Try to figure out beforehand when you will have more than 30 minutes free from any commitment.
    - # What is the Right Deep Work Strategy for You?
        - In “ [Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) “, Paul Graham argues there are two types of workers:
        - Makers usually have clear goals that are very valuable. Think about programmers, architects, and writers. Their projects are very tangible and their output measurable.
        - But that is not the case for most managers. Their objectives are much more subjective and difficult to measure. On top of that, they usually have many smaller tasks.
        - A “Maker” works best in long, uninterrupted chunks. A “Manager” typically works in one hour blocks, changing subjects frequently.
- I'm on a [[transition stage]] that shift myself from the imposing structure of social to comeback to [[unattachment centering]] so that I could operate in a way that true harmony with reality, not society.
- [[my quotes]]
[[true harmony]] is the harmony between our true self and reality, not the ego self and society.
- My [[mindset]] is now from the higher-self and the rest of the lower-self. 
    - For example, grateful and ungrateful. Love and no love, Respect and unrespect. There is no need to care the differences of lower-self. Just need to know it is lower-self to aim to higher-self. [[indifferentiated]]
