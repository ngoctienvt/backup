- I felt so much emotions inside my heart last night. I felt that I'm so disturb, and angy when people or things I respect was judged by other people. I also felt uncomfortable with people who judge other people because I fear that it will misleading other people in the wrong direction.
- I realized that what's best I can do for now is focus on myself, let my work do the talk, less talk and more accept/ more release. I will not let my personal needs or samskaras blur out my ability to respect the reality. I am feel much more happy that this is my chance for gradually expand my ability to embrace reality and let go of my personal stuff, especially the one that have attachments with my preferences.
- What I need to focus on is not myself, my career, or the person, I need to focus on release my internal stuff so that I don't have to protect these personal stuff, and put the people I care about above them.
- Last night, I dream and notice that I want to win and hate to lose, this is because I'm so identified with my need of recognition but forget that's what's important is the person, not my stuff.
- Today I will have a chat with [[@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh]]. And I want to take less time to talk about myself, but rather relax, conscious at the moment and let myself embrace her. And let my inner shakti do the work to take care of her, respect her, give her space for growth.
- The way a person develop their [[Level of expertise]] is start with
    - Creating a space for their skill development
    - Deepen their skill on that space
    - Expand gradually
    - From general to context
    - From low perspective to high perspective
    - From surface understanding to deep understanding
    - From practice to master to show the work
    - From ambiguous to clear and clarity
    - From verbose to concrete and concise
- I noticed that general is for low-level of understanding, while in high level, it's require given concext so that's people can learn from the context and then level up their own understanding. [[level of thinking]]
