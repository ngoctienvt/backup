- The [[starting point]] of everything is established a solidify [[basic foundation]] so that I can come back at any time. The role of a basic foundation is to establish a [[ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach]], a broad viewpoint that includes things I want to work on. It would help to set me a [[truth compass]] to come back when I feel lost or to expand myself based on the experience that I gained. [[life flow]] [[ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach]]
    - The reason to have a [[starting point]] is to realize that things have different levels or different progress to work on. [[ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach]] The starting point is established by 
        - learning and getting used to what's possible, 
        - what's the floor and what's the possible ceiling?
        - what's the meaning of this?
    - After establishing a starting point, the next thing is about the [[mastery]] process. The process of mastery is what's I actually do in the [[ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach]] that I defined. 
        - It's about listing the things that I want to master. The things to master will have different levels as well. 
            - One is to understand the components.
            - Second is to have a synthesis or a goal to use things together. [[synthesis]]
        - Choose and go deep to acquire a [[deeper understanding]] in each thing [[bottom-up approach
        - Synthesis things by a [[ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach]] that have goals, challenges, application oriented as a result.
        - Reflection after each learning to condense knowledges and experiences. [[condensing and generative process]]
    - The third step is going beyond.
        - Come back to the foundation and start to [[bottom-up approach things.
