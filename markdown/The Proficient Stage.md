- Develop intuitive sense of what the goal should be based on the context or given situation
    - Don't know exactly how to do yet
    - A shift from competent to proficient is 
        - a change from perspective
            - Competent making personal choices related to what they need to focus on based on [[personal rules]]
            - While a proficient person intuitively knows what they need to focus on and keep their focus on that. 
            - The proficient person focus on what's important, while the competent person try based on their rigid rules
        - they start to move from attachment with outcome to the focus point/ the bigger goal
- Going from Competent to Proficient
    - Internalized what data need to focus on
        - There’s still a __choice__ being made about what to focus on, it’s not __intuitive__.
    - Keep employing deliberate practice around 
        - what to focus on 
        - set as your goal 
        - assess the outcomes in order to reach proficiency.
    - Note
        - As you get better at picking what data and goals to focus on, you will slowly develop a more intuitive understanding of which decisions will do well and which ones won’t and you’ll move from competent to proficient.
        - It will be an emergent shift. You won’t be able to do it as deliberately as you did the last three, rather, you’ll wake up one day and realize you know what to focus on.
            - You’ll look at a chess board and know what your goal should be. You’ll look at a setting and know what variables to focus on with your photo. You’ll look at a site and know which marketing tactics will work well for it.
        - To become Proficient, keep practicing and collecting more experience **until your chosen perspective becomes intuitive.** **Until you have a sense of what to focus on and what goals to set** instead of having to choose it deliberately.
