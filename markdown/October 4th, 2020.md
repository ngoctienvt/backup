- I felt that I feel much more uplifted energy inside of me now. I still have a lot of work to complete myself but the path is already there and I know what I need to do. My [[intention]] is started to become clearer and everything started to merge with each other. 

Today I want to work more on some of the things I still work on:
    - way of living life
    - intention
    - coaching with [[Nguyễn Mỹ Linh]]
    - outline about [[mind-training]]
- I'm thinking about doing a short training about using Roam for people to try it before I do my real training. However, I still concern about the picture is not clear and the process is not completed so it would make people become confused about the approach. 

I noticed that when I'm approaching things to train others, I like to work from a [[top-down boundary]] as this helps me to ensure that the value and the understanding are there for them. However, this also put pressure too much on my shoulder. Ideally, I want to have some small top-down ideas [[breakdown]] that I want to develop and work to complete these fragments and train them as well. This is exactly how [[progressive approach]] in action but not only I work in my mind but I put them, in reality, to experiment and get feedback as well. [[training method]]
- [[mind-training]] [[training method]] I feel that if I try to solve too many things in one course, it would become a mess and no real things got solved. I want to approach this in a different way of thing a bit. 
    - I want to set enough [[basic foundation]] for people to understand the process and what really happens. 
        - how learning really happens
        - how mind works
        - the relationship between tools and users
        - users - what they need to do
        - tools - how to use them in an effective way
        - how to make the progress happens naturally
    - After setup the basic foundation, I will want to support people to work on each things in-depth or start to get used to things with [[progressive approach]]
    - I also want to develop some clear goal-oriented practices or activities so that people can just simply focus their minds on this. I would call this as a boundary or a limitation that the mind can focus on instead of scattering. Temporary I would like to call it as [[constraint]].
- [[Book - How to take smart notes]] [[truth]] [[writing]]
    - [[writing]] is not only a final test, a separate step that public thing out, but rather similar to a discussion, writing is a means to externalize the thoughts, ideas, the unanswered questions to find the truth. Because it's very easy to be distorted and lost if it kept and work on the unstable mind. [[truth]] [[externalization]]
    - Attending lectures or training program, reading books or articles, discussion with others and writing itself is all the means to discover the [[truth]]
    - So what's important is to realize that the truth is there to be find out, but it does not belong to anyone. The [[truth]] belong to itself, and everything else are just the [[means]] to understand more about the truth. 
    - I need to see things [[as a whole]] instead of separation and understand the process behind everything more deeply so I can use the [[means]] in an effective way, instead of lost in the [[tools]]. Because it's more important that the [[users]] learned how to use tools properly to gain [[deeper understanding]] about truth.
- [[coaching reflection]] Last night coaching with Kỳ Anh, I felt that my energy and focus are quite low, I also lost in the mind that how coaching really works for me. It seems like I'm trying too hard and didn't let the coaching process really occurs naturally. I also really not hold what's the [[end goals]] that suitable for [[deep coaching]] to happen but rather just work mindlessly. 

Ideally, the [[coaching process]] will need to have these things:
    - a goal that address the true issues, hidden concerns, or what's significant instead of surface levels.
    - an approach that reaching and [[closing the gap]], to feel the the session is moving forward 
        - stretching the clients so that it opened the space for the underlying issues emerge instead of just focus on what is or what happens [[condition for emergence]]
            - [[hold the space]] that needed for the [[emergence]] of [[insights]] that appear and facilitate
            - facilitate the learning of clients and a action or direction to move forward next
    - coach has the fulfilled inner energy so that it will raise clients up instead of bringing them down [[energy management]] [[raise the moments]]
    - coach has a [[empty mind]] that has a clear intention and fully present at the moment to dance with shakti. [[coaching mastery]]
        - For this to happen, I need to have a clear [[constraint]] and a clear understanding about what coaching really is, what is the boundary and how the [[coaching process]] really happens
- Malcom Mclean dont want to get stuck into traffics so he invented the way to ship things through container by ship. And this is the thing no one think before, because the reason is not because it’s better, but actually it solved the unrelated traffic problems for him. We don’t change the world by a top-down approach, we change them by [[meeting the demand of reality]] that happens seem like very small issues before us. [[impactful being]]

    - He also clear that the important is the [[purpose]] or the [[end goals]] instead of the temporary tools that we are having for a different purpose. And only when connecting the true purpose and align everything else to match that purpose, only that tiem the real [[impactful results]] appear.
- [[Book - How to take smart notes]] rather than put information into topics, [[progressive approach]] put information in different contexts that I want to see them again. And each context is a node, a idea, a thought that worth considering and working on.

Nothing is start from scratch. If you want to do something, it must have generate by somewhere, your experience, your difficulty, other existing ideas. Not brainstorming but rather a [[progressive approach]] to [[optimal conditions]] for [[emergence]] to happens.
- [[Roam Research]] [[progressive approach]] [[mind-training]] I'm thinking that how could I clean up the fleeting notes that got used to permanent notes without losing their values in an [[convenient]] way, so that my [[Roam Research]] personal knowledge garden can grow up in a helpful way and not become cluster over time. [[clean up fleeting notes]]
- When I read about the routines of Andy - evergreen notes, I feel that I also want to shift myself to that directions. To have a routine habit and activities that like a [[life flow]] or [[workflow]] that naturally to me but also keep me on the right track.
- I felt a little bit nervous to coach for Linh. I want to center myself and let me fully relax and trust things to unfold in a natural way. Release all of my needs, my fear, and let my true self in charge of the situation.
- After the coaching session, I feel much more comfortable with [[Nguyễn Mỹ Linh]] and become natural with each other, rather than fear, need for recognition. I started to be myself, trust myself, share what best, and trust the process.

I feel happy that she realized things that she wasn't able to resolve in the past. She also realized the inner path to start with it. I'm happy with the fact that she's seeing the truth. She started to really build the inner well-being.
