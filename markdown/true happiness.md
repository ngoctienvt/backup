- For me, what makes a true happiness are 
    - [[true freedom]] - the inner freedom that we got free from the inner urge and the inner thoughts
    - seeking and living the truth on a [[progressive approach]] [[wisdom]] - let go of the untruth and have the courage to direct ourselves to live the truth, as it's the only sustainable way
- true happiness is a [[natural way of living life]] process, not a [[forceful]] process. And it's the inner state that could achieve without any external things.
