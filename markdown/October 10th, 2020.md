- I felt that there are some people make me feel want to support them more than normal people. I'm not so sure why but I feel that I want to see them better. Somehow there is a connection between me and them, and their happiness will influence my happiness [[attachment]], so actually it's not fully about them, but because my happiness is a part of that. 

It's not fully impersonal and for other, it's still have a personal part. [[true love]] is there is no personal part exist, or at least there is an awareness that it still exists and need to clean.
- I felt a little worry about this morning. I felt that I tend to put pressure on myself too much to not do the things wrong [[self-pressure]]. There is a fear that I don't do things effectively and there is also a mistrust on other people abilities to develop their own uniqueness and their own learning. [[trust the process]]. 

There is also a [[need for recognition]] that I haven't resolved fully yet. This is a chance for me to learn to let simply lean back, relax, and let everything do it works, and only do a little bit of my work in an impersonal way to add for the whole. [[part of a whole]]
- [[true happiness]] There are 3 things that we can never escape of
    - body - human senses
    - emotions - the piano that can play any notes
    - inner thoughts - the radio 
    - If we want to run away from it to have freedom, that's freedom always temporary and never sustainable because you are just temporary distracting yourself from that. [[freedom]] [[distraction]]
- [[wisdom]] is not simply the truth because there is different levels of truth that we can see. Wisdom here is the insights that you can draw from the [[situational context]] that you experiences to see the wholer picture. 

To see the higher truth all the time and only keeps higher because you merge the experiences to each other. It's just actually become wholer and there will be no limit for that. The only limit is your ability to handle that level of truth. [[level of development]] 

It's about whether you are evolved and expand yourself enough to handle that truth, and this is what we lived for. [[capacity to handle]] [[soul evolution]]
- [[weekly reflection]] 10/10/2020
    - This week I felt that I started to get used to the way of natural living. I don't need to push myself too hard but my life still naturally moving forward, and I'm also able to aware what prevents myself to live that way as well. 
    - I felt that I'm naturally expanding and handling what's left inside of me that triggered everyday. I don't need to find it or wait until it becomes too much. 
    - I also felt that when I started to clean things, I'm becoming more and more energy inside that naturally moves me. I reduced the fear that I won't make anything meaningful for this life, because the fact that I learn things and improve my soul everyday is the best that I could do to be able to handle bigger [[demand of reality]]
    - The more I write, the more things integrate inside myself, and the more I feel I can ready to move to the next level as well. [[integration activity]]
    - [[productivity]] for me 
        - is not to do more things but to fully learn things that already there. 
        - is not forcing but rather gaining understanding about the [[flow of life]] 
            - to guide ourselves naturally to that flow
            - and surrender what's making us get out of that flow
        - is not making choices but rather creating [[optimal conditions]] for the naturally choices emerge [[design for emergence]]
- I felt that myself feels uncomfortable when hearing others people give guidance for other people, even though I know they have good intention. [[emotions]] [[uncomfortable with advices]]
- I felt that I still have a lot of attach with what's [[convenient]] for me and feel very disturb when they are not in sync, and makes me need to adapt with it. [[samskaras]] The convenient samskara is still the big lessons that I haven't work with yet.
- I also felt uncomfortable to things about how I need to pay [[money]] to streamline my workflow. There is a conflict between [[convenient]] with [[money]] that I haven't worked with it at all.
- I also felt that I hate to deal with things that half good half past and need to make decision. [[conscious choice]] When I felt that I need to make conscious choices, I felt a feeling of tired and it looks like a burden that I need to handle with. [[getting in touch with reality]]
