    - The next session is about visioning or straightening the path, so that participants can much better focus on their journey and have a direction to move forward without feeling lost anymore.
    - In order to do that, it's important to draw the path from where they are and where they will be next from the last session. 
    - Is there any pre-work needed for the session?
        - Participants need to be able to close the past and clear about what they will focus next that will serve the next  stage
        - It's also important to clarify the success factors that's helpful for them so far
        - The whole work is about helping them to shine the light on the right path that they have been gone through. So that's they could connect them deeply, and will use it to orient the next stage.
        - It's also important to clarify the meaning of the role will not be easy to know, because life is evolving in itself in a direction that no one even know what's waiting at the end.
