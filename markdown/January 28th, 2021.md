- I started to see that I'm learning to see how life truly happens and how I can live harmony and meaningful with it. We need to learn this, because without the right understanding and right attitude, we will suffer as a result. Life always have results, and it is consequences or rewards based on our attitude and intention. 
    - And I'm on my way to streamline my life in some way so that I can live truly happy with this life and grow exponentially, and serve unconditionally.
    - Some of the main principles are
        - Life happens independent with how my mind wants. [[variety nature of everything]]
        - The root thing is realizing that preferences and inability to handle experiences are what make me suffer. The ultimate solution is handle them, not about control the world or wish things not happen. [[personal preferences]]
        - Learning to include is the best way to grow and to serve. What seems wrong is because we act based on our personal needs without include other people. [[inclusion]]
            - Learning to let go my personal needs and include other people to raise them and raise myself up is the highest way that I can learn to live.
            - Thinking is only a part of the evolution and learning process, I need to reconstructure myself properly to embrace a new system way of living that harmony with life. 
            - Whatever makes me feel disturbances now are because of what happens inside of me, not because of external things.
        - Curiosity could be the guidance for me to unfold my potentials, but somehow it needs to have a little bit guidances from my end goals. This will help me remain focus and live a deeper life, rather than a narrow life, and not willing to go deep like now. [[ðŸŒ²Bottom-up Emergence]] 
            - The fear of commitment and the greed of want everything freeze me at the crossroads, I need to reframe my way of seeing life.
                - The whole points are still preferences, because I see some experiences are better than others, that's why I have a fear of missing out.
                - Actually I don't need to care much about this, as long as I resist nothing, I can merge the bottom-up and the destination, because on the journey, many things unfold and I don't have to rush through to go the end goal.
                    - As long as I enjoy the process, everything is fine.
        - What is permanent is me and my growth. Everything else are impermanent and could go anytime. I need to appreciate, honor, and grateful about them, but also unattach with them as the same time. [[ðŸŒ±Unshakable Centering]]
    - I also notice that what's important is not what could be, but what I actually will. It's not about how many games I could have, but how many games I have played and grew from that. Living, not satisfy personal needs and preparing.
        - The focus point will be about processing, not about collecting and preparing.
    - And process what will have me to close the gap.
- I noticed that I still feel restless and not have compassion, acceptance, understand for other people current stages. I have an expetection and an attachment as well as judgement that why it's so simple but people doesn't understand. [[true growth]]
    - This is an very important thing that I need to let go, because it is against my intention to raise other people up. This attitude only satisfy my personal needs rather than raising other people, I will need to truly go deep and handle it if I want to serve people unconditionally in the best way as possible. [[raise the moments]]
        - This is where I learn to be humble, be compassion, be understanding, and be patient.
        - This is where I need to let go my most proud parts that relate to my intelligence, my strengths, my specialness, in a way that I still have them but not attach to them to feel value about myself.
