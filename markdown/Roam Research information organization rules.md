- fleeting notes write on daily notes
- condensing notes [[living from the place of surrender]]
    - general concept on its own topic
    - sub-information on the nodes itself
- publishing notes
- 
- What I want from the way I organize my personal knowledge are:
    - I can check the definition and general understanding about a concept easily
    - I can see the flow of information easily
    - I can upgrade and edit the condensing notes easily
    - Each note hold the information (outline) that in the same level, the detailer level is on the sub-notes
- When to use block reference?
    - Block reference is things that I can refer a block of content from other notes to this page. It mostly useful when I want to see them in the same place and don't have the intention to change the context in this place.
        - Basically, the main notes still in its place and reference only for mention or display purpose only.
