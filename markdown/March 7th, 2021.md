- [[üìùWeekly Review]]
    - The life goal or the path of life is starting to clearer. It's all about direct lower energy to become higher energy and express it to serve the world.
        - This is how things meant to be. Through this path, we will become harmony with life and live it as it is. 
        - To be able to do this, we need to learn to grow, to embrace lower energy, to accept every single things of life, so that we can become wholer and able to be handle them, embrace them, accept them fully. Grow to become a true merger.
            - If not, we will be split by our tendency of resisting or clinging. We will make things become complicated and splitting.
        - This path will have some main checkpoint. [[The life path]]

        - I will play more Life is strange next week to learn more about this
    - Uniqueness is about how a seed will bloom into something and express its true potential - the focus currently will be about trust the uniqueness and let me express myself in the most natural way by letting go all of fears, beliefs, concepts, thinking...
    - True love is much more freedom, natural, and not bound by anything. I'm not fully clear about this yet, but I'm starting to sense it, nurture it, and carve the path.
    - My resistance and defensiveness with my family will focus on the next week.
    - [[How to live the life path]] will somehow related to 4 mudra
        - 1st mudra - karma mudra - our actions
            - It needs to be "to√†n t√¢m to√†n √Ω" - fully focus and fully express to FULLY UNDERSTAND, then we can let go it
        - 2nd mudra - gyan mudra - knowledges 
            - It needs to be let go what we think we know to only KEEP WHAT WE TRULY KNOW
            - What you know for sure?
        - 3rd mudra - samaya mudra - time 
            - It needs to be fully center at now - no future, no past - let go all of past and future - let go the mind
        - 4th mudra - maha mudra - pure consciousness
            - This is what only left when everything above is gone
    - Anyway, this week is so meaningful as I have so many new experiences, true understanding. I felt that I am becoming much clearer about the path that I always seek and how to be able to live it. I felt so much happy now.
- I noticed that true love is about the true life path that two people aim to and support, share to each other in the process to live each other true life path.
    - It's not personal, it's about together.
- I also noticed that my true life path is not able to include everything in life yet, and still have the tendency to exclude them because I am not clear about the path yet.
