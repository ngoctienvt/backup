    - Connecting instead of categorizing. Categorizing is to help the mind able to [[extract and gather information]] easier, but it's not the real power of the mind. The power of it is on the ability to generate new things from old things. [[generative wisdom]] [[condensing process]] - **generative is the nature of the mind.**
    - The mind is not a good [[information storehouse]], because it will only remember what it's interested in and the [[general impression]] but not the detail. Because we have a [[limited source of energy]], so our mind will unconsciously remove or change the information in a way that it is related to other central nodes that already in there. 
        - The mind is not a good [[information storehouse].
        - The mind is not [[energy-efficiency]] to withdraw and maintain information in our mind.
    - We - the [[witness consciousness]] - is the person who can direct the mind to generate wisdom by putting our energy into the [[condensing process]]. The main way is by using questions to provoke the mind to think in that direction. [[powerful questions]].
    - We can also give it materials by input experiences, reading books, experimenting,... This is [[input process]] so the mind can have materials to continue it [[condensing process]].
