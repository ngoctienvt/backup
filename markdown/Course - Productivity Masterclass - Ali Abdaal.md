    - Productivity = (Useful or Meaningful Output)/ Time * fun factor
        - Aspect that could be [[targeted intervention]]
        - Productive about the right thing [[on the right track]]
    - Mental model about productivity [[productivity mental model]]
        - Pilot - 10% - clarity - **Useful** [[intention]]
            - Set the course of the plane
            - Figure out what direction the plane is heading in
            - Gives the instruction to the plane
        - Plane - 80% - **Output** [[execution]]
            - Follow the course, not deviate
            - Take off efficiently, land safely
        - The engineer - 5-10% - **Time** [[maintenance]]
            - Make sure the plane is efficient
            - Fuel efficient
            - Keep the system organized 
    - Reflective question
        - Which do I struggle most of all? In what specific way? 
            - I struggle with most of them [[personal challenges]]
                - For the pilot, I struggle to set the long destination, and break down to small milestones that ensure to keep me on the right direction.
                - For the plane, I'm not comfortable to work on the long period of time, and sometimes I'm just kind of working in a circle or let things emerge appear by themselves, but not actually fully active working on this.
                - For the engineer, I'm just starting to build my system, before that, I just keep myself at least on the not breakdown level and too much stress.
- ### [["I don't have time" myth]]
    - Time is what we want most, but what we use worst - William Penn [[efficient]]
        - We always choose to do something, and not do something. 
            - It's not we don't have time, it's not our priority
            - It's not the case limited by time, it's a case that limited by the choices that we make with our time.
    - From "I don't have time" to "I'm choosing not to make the time".  
        - Train our brain not to say "Sorry I don't have time" but "I have other priority things to do..."
        - Tips
            - Write down exactly what you are doing with your time - tracking it to get in touch with the reality
    - Reflective question
        - What is the reason for me using the phrase I don't have time?
            - I don't feel meaning on that - small talk, listening other people problem without seeing their intention to resolve it
            - I feel tired and I want to rest
            - I'm not interested on that
        - Optional action - tracking your time on 1 week
- ### [[motivation myth]]
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FNgoctien%2F2G_MQglYWD.png?alt=media&token=ad06b972-c4e4-43b8-86fa-6b3bb9778572)
    - We think we had to have the feeling of doing something to do something. [[false belief]]
        - Relying on our feelings to work is a receipt for disaster, because it's not reliable. [[solid foundation]]
            - It's about the true self choose to do something, not about give up our free-will to our heart.  [[freewill]]
    - The outcome is usually long time on the future, we don't have an immeditate feedback. [[getting in touch with reality]] continuously
        - Make the action [[samskaras-based solution]]
            - more pleasurable 
                - (game, friendly competition like boardgame, process goal, environment. music...)
            - consequences of inaction more painful. 
                - It's kind of trigger the pain samskaras.
                - Deadline, pre-paid money, beeminder, 
        - Make the outcome [[inner clarity]]
            - short-term [[built-in feedback loop]]
                - example of feedback loops, game, sports,...
            - making the outcome more salient, more clear [[inner clarity]]
    - The ideal is we don't need motivation in the first place, but rather nurture our will-power to overcome these habit-formed will and transform them into our desired habit pattern  instead. [[willpower]]
        - You don't need the motivation to go to work or to go to school to do exam.
    - Reflective thinking
        - The most important thing I learn is I don't have to give my right to my feelings and my thoughts, I need to learn to become the one who direct my life, so that they become my servant instead.
        - [[samskaras-based solution]] is helpful for short-term, but for long-term, it's better to let go of the inner blockages and build up the [[conscious will]] instead.
        - It's very important to build ourselves based on a [[solid foundation]] which usually based on truth, reality or the natural flow of inner energy, instead of our feelings and our thoughts. 
- [[multi-tasking myth]]
    - Do work at the same time create the feeling of productive, but not actually. [[getting in touch with reality]]
    - [[flow state]] is an optimal consciousness state that we can completely focused on one thing.
        - put ourselves on [[stretch zone]] so that we can focused on it 
        - absence of distractions
            - internal
            - external
    - Reflective questions
        - What's situation when I was in my 'flow state'?
        - What's circumstances and mindsets led to that?
        - How can I create the optimal conditions to let me in that state?
- 3 laws of productivity
    - Parkinson's law
        - Work expands to fill the time that we allocate to it
            - Having too much time to do something is a recipe for procrastination
        - Think about 10 years plan and ask "How can you achieve it within 6 months?"
        - Application
            - Giving ourselves artificial deadline - [[constraint]]
                - But our mind knows it is an artificial deadline, so you can make it become a real deadline, like giving money to someone and lost it if you can't complete tasks.
        - Reflection
            - What are long-term tasks I want to do?
                - Developing personal knowledge development system
                - Developing training program for the above system
                - 
            - What would I do if only had half as long to do them?
            - What if I have only next 24 hours?
    - Pareto principle 
        - 80% of the result comes from 20% of the effort.
        - 80% of the output comes from 20% of the input...
        - significant diminishing returns
        - What is your end goal here? And what is 20% that I need to do to achieve it?
        - Continual process of 80/20 and whatever is left. 
            - Filling the picture is more important than filling the detail.
        - Reflection
            - What 20% of my work is driving 80% of my meaningful output?
                - Meditation
                - Thinking
            - What's taking up 80% of my time but not actually contributing much to my outcomes?
                - Organizing
                - Youtube/ Facebook/ passive listening...
    - Newton's first law of motion
        - An object is at rest or travelling at a constant velocity unless it's acted on by an external, imbalanced force.
            - If something is still, stay still. If we stay still, it is require external force.
            - If something is moving, it will keep moving forward. 
        - It's harder to start something than to continue doing something.
        - Tips
            - 2-minute rule - if something takes less than 2 minutes, do it now rather than todo list
            - 5-minute rule - if we struggle to start with any task,  just do 5 minute of it
            - do mindless work, setting up things, reduce friction
            - Keystone habit- if we do one habit, it will lead to other thing
                - For example, if I have habit to stay sitting on my chair instead of my bed
- The 3 powers of productivity
    - The power of habit or consistency
        - [[habit]] are atomic
        - [[compound interests]]
            - The inability to understand exponential function
        - Skip the need for willpower to close the gap of thoughts and actions
        - [[samskaras-based solution]] Social contract - public commitment
        - habit is about identity-change, internal-change, and reinforce the new identity
            - breaking limiting beliefs, thoughts
            - breaking the stories that our mind tell to ourselves
        - Reflection
            - What 3 things would boost my productivity if it become my habit?
                - Sitting on my chair
                - Writing regularly
            - How I could start to build these habits?
    - The power of productive downtime
        - daily highlight - what is my highlight for the day?  what is one thing I want to get done today? 
        - todo list - morning dump
        - admin task
        - Reflection
            - What are some chunks of the day in which I find myself wasting time  in ways I'd rather not?
            - What usefull small things could I do with that time instead?
    - The power of productive procrastination
        - doing something that's inherently useful for bottom-up knowledge
        - Reflection
            - friction and intentional direction is very important  to build up a life that's progressive moving forward.
- The fun factor
    - What's the point of life?
        - Enjoyment
        - Evolution
        - Contribution
    - If we decide what we like and what we won't like, we actually limit and actively make our journey on earth is tough.
    - Making the process or the journey on earth more fun on each moment, not someday/maybe. [[enjoy the process]]
    - "have to" versus "get to" - neutralize the negative
        - I get to do this 
    - designing enjoyable environment to help digest the experience easier
    - learning to expand our ability to enjoy the variety of moments
