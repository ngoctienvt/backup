- Reliance on recipes
    - No context for why they're doing
    - No personal perspectives
        - Don't know what they need to focus on
    - Decision-making in a linear and rule-based way
    - Detachment from the process and outcomes / no personal emotions involvement
- The challenge
    - Tendency to blame the recipe
    - Easily to get stuck and don't know how to solve own trouble
- Going from Zero to Novice
    - At this stage **focus on collecting and trying recipes**.
        - You should be reading books, blogs, listening to speeches, taking classes, whatever will give you a large repertoire of recipes as fast as possible.
        - But you can’t just read them, **you have to apply them**. Try following along with them, doing whatever is being talked about, and not just reading.
    - If you only read or hear about the recipes but don’t do them yourself **it is impossible to move beyond novice.**
    - The next stage requires a contextual understanding of different situations and the only way you develop that context is through practice. [[contextual understanding]]
