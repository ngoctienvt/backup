- Today I will focus on integrating my thoughts about [[ðŸŒ±Instructional Design]]
    - Also merge and clarify my thoughts around level of expertise and my own Bloom's with the verb as well.
- I noticed that this period of time is when I'm starting to learn to shift my focus on working [[ðŸŒ²Top-down Processing]] and [[getting in touch with reality]]. This will help me to not focus too much on my thoughts, but rather reality instead. 
    - The fact that I let myself open is helpful for learning, but it's hinder my ability to serve the reality.
    -  The word Top-down Processing is better than Top-down End goals, because I can work at any level I want, and solidfy from that level downward, but remain open for later.
    - My focus will be on my list of current processing and let other stuff emerge by itself, let it teach me, and I will process them later.
