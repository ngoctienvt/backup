- In Hinduism, dharma is simultaneously the eternal order that rules the universe and the duty or law that governs one’s life. Fulfilling one’s dharma is more than simply one’s purpose in life – it is considered the very means by which one transcends suffering and the cycle of birth and death, or what is called __saṃsāra__.
