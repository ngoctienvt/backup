- Evergreen notes are notes that are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time through intellectual thinking.
    - The smallest fundamental block of evergreen notes are [[information blocks]]
        - [[types of information blocks]]
- Type of evergreen notes:
    - Based on purpose
        - One will be for my own understanding - concept notes, process notes
            - non-directional notes
                - Systems:
                    - [A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/A_writing_inbox_for_transient_and_incomplete_notes))

        - Second is about further understanding and serving reality through teaching to other people.
            - directional notes

                    - [Prefer positive note titles to promote systematic theory](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Prefer_positive_note_titles_to_promote_systematic_theory)
    - Based on the structure of content
        - Map of contents are the navigating system that organize my central nodes
            - Centralized notes are the notes that highly develop with many evergreen notes 
                - Atomic notes
                    - Concepts/ideas/process note
                    - Explaining notes
                    - Blog notes/ Articles notes
                    - Argument notes
                    - Meta API notes
                        - These notes are the “meta” notes, that start to build on ideas you have developed across multiple lower-levels of notes. Andy compares these notes to “API”s, in that they then become useful “handles” for developing ideas at the highest levels of complexity.
                        - When [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note’s ideas can then be referenced using that handle.
                        - In fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develop ideas in notes over time, and improve the “APIs,” you’ll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees (e.g. “[Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Enacted_experiences_have_incredible_potential_as_a_mass_medium)”, “[Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note-writing_as_fundamental_unit_of_knowledge_work)”).
                        - Some effective note “API design” techniques:
                            - **separation of concerns **([Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic)),
                            - **sharp titles** ([Prefer declarative and imperative note titles to sharpen claims](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Prefer_declarative_and_imperative_note_titles_to_sharpen_claims)), and
                            - **positive framings** ([Prefer positive note titles to promote systematic theory](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Prefer_positive_note_titles_to_promote_systematic_theory)).
