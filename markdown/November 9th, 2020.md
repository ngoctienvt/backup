- Last night [[dream]], I have a fear about bad things, unpleasant things, I feel so much disturbed that I feel hard to center and let go. I need to remember that everything is just energy nurture energy, they are the energy of experiences that come to nurture me - the soul - the energy, so there is no need to fear and resist. They will not be able to harm me, but only teach me the nature of everything.

The reason I fear and resist is I thought that they will harm me, but I'm not the physical person, I'm the energy that can't die, and impressions, samskaras can't kill me.
- About the front door, I start to learn to feel safe and put more trust into the reality. I learn to let go my attachment for stuff and the feeling of owning something. [[fear]]
