-  This week focus:
    - {{[[TODO]]}} working on [[journey of wisdom]]
        - Start to work on the level of creating MOCs and evergreen notes
    - {{[[TODO]]}} improving coaching skills
- Last night [[dream]], I have a fear about bad things, unpleasant things, I feel so much disturbed that I feel hard to center and let go. I need to remember that everything is just energy nurture energy, they are the energy of experiences that come to nurture me - the soul - the energy, so there is no need to fear and resist. They will not be able to harm me, but only teach me the nature of everything.

The reason I fear and resist is I thought that they will harm me, but I'm not the physical person, I'm the energy that can't die, and impressions, samskaras can't kill me.
- About the front door, I start to learn to feel safe and put more trust into the reality. I learn to let go my attachment for stuff and the feeling of owning something. [[fear]]
- I'm on the stage learning how to forming my personal knowledge and generating output. And somehow this is nearly all of my workflow because usually, I don't count coaching, training as part of my workflow. The reason is I don't do them too often, but actually [[workflow]] is a bigger picture of [[personal knowledge development]].

So I will complement my workflow for personal knowledge development first.
- [[coaching reflection]] I noticed that sometimes I couldn't just reflect and question, sometimes I need to have clients to have some options to clarify their thoughts, especially when they keep going around. This is the same as me, as I'm on a stage learning how to facilitate my own thoughts to become clearer and directional by learning the MOCs stage.

The situation also needs to be specific to explore, as clients can easily relate to their context and learn from that. I can also learn more on them based on that situation rather than work as general context.
- My [[workflow]] somehow will need to cover the entire of my life and not separate by my roles or what I do, but need to have something much more general and role-independent.
