- Session 1 - Who am I
    - [[Who am I]] [[spiritual growth]]  In the first lecture, Michael Singer taught that who we really are? He proved that my body is not me through various examples. 
        - First, spiritual growth is realizing that there is an object that I am looking at. Second, there is an act of paying attention to it. Third, realizing that I am the one who is looking, not the one I am looking at. [[self-awareness]]
        - [[surrender]] is not about giving up the world, but let go of the part inside of me that are not living the truth. [[surrender]] is remember that I'm always the one who is looking and anything I can look is not myself, but the object that I'm looking at. [[wisdom]] [[letting go]]
        - I am the [[witness conscious]]. I have the ability to project my consciousness and my attention to other objects. However, I am easy to lose myself and [[pay attention]] too much into the objects that I'm very hard to pay attention to what I am doing, and to come back to pay attention to myself. 
        - I am also easy to [[identify]] myself with other objects and forget that I can't be hurt because I don't have a body. I can feel hurt, but this is just an experience that I feel temporarily when I connect with my body, but "I" can't be hurt, because I am not having body.
        - I also don't look at things outside, I look at them inside, but my mind render it in a way that cover entire of my vision, so it makes me feel like I am looking at things outside, because there is no black edge around makes me realize that I am looking at it inside. [[mind rendering]]
        - I'm inside and I experience 3 main things:
            - The world outside that comes into my consciousness through my body senses.
            - The thoughts created by the mind.
            - The emotions that emerged from the heart.
        - I also not used to disconnect external things, so I am easy to distract by them. And because I tend to distract by them, so it's hard for me to [[resist the urge]] to focus on them and focus on myself instead. Because they are much more [[interesting]] and easy to focus on instead of me. [[distraction]]
        - So if I want to focus back on myself: [[unattachment centering]]
            - I need to remove distraction so the less the distraction is, the easier I can focus on myself.
            - I need to learn to [[resist the urge]] that make me [[pay attention]] to the [[object of consciousness]] to practice [[willpower]] to withdraw my attention to the [[seat of consciousness]]. 
        - The [[nature of being]] is beautiful, no form, no physical body, easy to distract, and identify with the object of consciousness. When the [[witness consciousness]] identified itself with the other things, it feels the nature of that thing instead of itself. 
        - When I comeback to become a "witness consciousness", I will realize that the [[nature of being]] is not what I used to identify with, and I will realize that my mind can have problems and the things that come to me can make me feel it as a problem, but I am is beautiful, enough, and powerful than ever thing that come to me. 
- Session 2 - the outside world
    - [[the outside world]] [[spiritual growth]] In session 2, Michael Singer taught me the truth about the reality that they are created by itself which independent with myself.
        - Is the [[moment]] in front of me is the only moment in the universe?
        - Where does the moment in front of me coming from?
        - What makes me not okay with the moment that are giving to me?
        - The [[training method]] of Michael Singer is teaching students from a [[top-down boundary]] that starts with what's the truth, proving it and linking it slowly to the understanding of students. It creates conflict and separation in the mind of the students between the perception and the absolute truth. 
        - Due to this, students can start to learn to let go of the untruth, so they can realize what's left. The truth is always there, it didn't need you to agree that it's true or create your perception about it. It just needs us to open and aware its existence. [[absolute truth]] [[perception]] [[existence]]
