- [[沒抔eekly Review]]
    - Highlights:
        - I start to work with the attachment to what I think that other people should be based on my spiritual growth.
        - I start to grasp what coaching truly is and how my uniqueness will contribute to establish the way I coach
        - I work more to release the disturbances, the anger, the concept of fair, the fear of being trick or being in inferiority situation.
        - I start to read The heartfulness way to deepen and clarify my seeing about spirituality
        - I play less this week, while working more on things that emerge inside myself. I can see that the inner energy become stronger day by day.
        - I start to work on a translating project to deepen my insights about spirituality with other people.
        - I notice that I have some judgements or feel annoy about other people that ask me to help but not in a structure way that make my life become more unpredictable and not have the stable I need. I will contemplate more on this part.
    - Reflection on change in sub-personalities [[sub-personality reflection]]
        - Ti蘯ｿn tho蘯｣i mﾃ｡i become more responsible and start to take more responsibility in day-to-day activities.  He still like to be entertain, but start to become more conscious and enjoy the process, rather than just being distracted or sinking into the object of consciousness.
        - Ti蘯ｿn yﾃｪu thﾆｰﾆ｡ng still learn to work with the inner need of love, relationship with families, and learn to appreciate and honor the other people as who they are without the need to relate them to myself.
        - Ti蘯ｿn thﾃｴng thﾃ｡i become less care about logic, slower to react, learn to expand the way of seeing, learn to include things rather than just using logical thinking to deal with the situation. He becomes wiser by expanding the capacity to embrace instead of thinking. He becomes much more calm, less trigger, less need for recognition, less judging other. He learn to see things in a deeper level, rather than just seeing in the surface level, and blaming other people.
        - Ti蘯ｿn phﾃ｡t tri盻ハ still learn new things, read in a natural way,  learn how to train. He becomes more stable and natural, rather than just appear when I feel that I'm going downward too much. 
        - Ti蘯ｿn nguyﾃｪn t蘯ｯc becomes much more peace, though it's still challenging for him in some situations, but I'm working on it. He becomes less judging, less react, feel more peace, and learn to release and live without hard principles.
        - It has been a great journey that I can feel everyone is merging into each other, they grow together, and they become less and less separate in me, but become more me as a whole, as an integrated being.
            - Ti蘯ｿn thﾃｴng thﾃ｡i and Ti蘯ｿn phﾃ｡t tri盻ハ seems like merge into Ti蘯ｿn phﾃ｡t tri盻ハ.
            - Ti蘯ｿn tho蘯｣i mﾃ｡i seems to evolve into Ti蘯ｿn t蘯ｭn hﾆｰ盻殤g.

            - Ti蘯ｿn nguyﾃｪn t蘯ｯc seems to become Ti蘯ｿn kiﾃｪn nh蘯ｫn, because he's learning to be patient and less judge other people.
