- Last night I dreamt about the fear of being wrong and making other people disappointed.
- [[batching methodology]] I started to be able to break doing activities to a different type of tasks
    - Reading and take-noting
    - Grouping
    - Tagging
    - Reread and structuring
- [[ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach]] also works for [[Creating phase]]. 
    - I could list 
        - areas 
        - topics 
        - and then works on multiple articles at once
    - Because depend on the ideas, the stages, the understanding that I have, I could nurture these posts and complete them slowly based on my understanding.
    - When they are mature enough, I can just simply publish it as a by-product of my understanding.
- When consolidating the first session of design workshop, I'm noticing that's I'm doing many tasks at once, and this leads to confusing, it would be better if I break them down and notice what bring me stress
    - I haven't generate keywords from the session 1, but already trying grouping them, and this is not natural, because the structure is not emerge yet.
- I feel that this is the period of time for me to practice [[batching methodology]] along with [[concrete thinking]].
    - Task batching is the act of batching similar tasks together and doing them all at once, rather than addressing them sporadically throughout the day.
        - Though the action to do the tasks are single, the objects of the tasks could be several
            - For example, if I want to read and highlights knowledge, the objects could be about spiritual, coaching, personal development...
            - By doing different objects at once, it will create more fun and less boredom, it will also less likely to excess bandwith and overwhelm me in that particular subjects. [[bandwith management]]
                - It will also help to practice [[ðŸŒ²Bottom-up Emergence]] and [[ðŸŒ±Progressive Development Approach]] effectively, so that I could slowly move up the ladder of my development in a sustainable and natural way. 
                    - I will have much more free bandwith inside when I'm releasing the inner samskaras that occupied my energy to think about the past and the future. I will be able to be more present with the now moment. [[presence]]
                - I will also learn to [[enjoy the process]] as the outcome is simply move up the ladder or moving forward in the right direction, instead of a pressure to satisfy inner samskaras or social pressures. [[process-oriented]]
- I noticed that I feel [[restless]] while waiting and having nothing to distract me.
    - This is a great opportunity for me to learn to let go these habit-formed wills and simply presence with the current moment.
