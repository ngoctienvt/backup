- "I will work on to have my own synthesis and condensing process first. It will need to solve few big [[Expanding questions]]"
    - "How will I handle the cluster of information so that I won't waste time to review the materials that I'm completely absorb?"
        - "Delete? Or query? Or filter? "
        - My takeaways:: 
            - Internal and external data will be tag freely to process and clean up later.
                - Data on daily inbox will be clean by deleting.
                - Data on external sources will be clean up as well, but could store in a way that if I need to use in other context later.
            - If certain data is too big or not ready to process yet, leave it there.
            - Tag need to have general tags, and the main idea of that for resolve easier later.
    - "How I will organize my way of tagging and creating page?"
        - Free-thoughts:: It's not clear for me yet. I think that free thoughts will not need tag, while the key summary, expanding answers, whatever that got condensed will need to have tag instead. So that's I don't waste time to re-read unprocessed thoughts. 
            - However, will there be  a different level of processed thoughts is another [[Expanding questions]]? And how will I organize this?
        - "[[contextual usages]]"
    - How I use Roam to encode the relationship between ideas based on atomic concept, evergreen source of truth based on references?
    - How I will organize my workplace for solving current work and clean up later?
