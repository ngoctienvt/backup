- "I will work on to have my own synthesis and condensing process first. It will need to solve few big [[Expanding questions]]"
    - "How will I handle the cluster of information so that I won't waste time to review the materials that I'm completely absorb?"
        - "Delete? Or query? Or filter? "
        - Free-thoughts: 
            - What's about internal data that got from articles, books?
                - I'm thinking about deleting as well, as I don't feel that I will work like other people that reference that information and process it later. I need to think more about this abit.
                - I can clean up my daily inbox thoughts, because I feel that I fully use it, so there is no need to keep it, and create the newness instead.
                - While data from books, or articles may need to be reuse?
                    - My point is I want to draw the data to generate output from my [[evergreen notes]] instead of unprocess information from articles, books, own thoughts...
        - My takeaways:: 
            - Internal and external data will be tag freely to clean up later.
                - Data on daily inbox will be clean by deleting.
            - I will try to clean up every bit of information and put them in their own proper node.
            - If certain data is too big or not ready to process yet, leave it there.
            - Tag need to have general tags, and the main idea of that for resolve easier later.
    - "How I will organize my way of tagging and creating page?"
        - Free-thoughts:: It's not clear for me yet. I think that free thoughts will not need tag, while the key summary, expanding answers, whatever that got condensed will need to have tag instead. So that's I don't waste time to re-read unprocessed thoughts. 
            - However, will there be  a different level of processed thoughts is another [[Expanding questions]]? And how will I organize this?
        - "[[contextual usages]]"
    - How I use Roam to encode the relationship between ideas based on atomic concept, evergreen source of truth based on references?
    - How I will organize my workplace for solving current work and clean up later?
