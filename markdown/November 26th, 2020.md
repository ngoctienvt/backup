- #min-all {{[[query]]: {and: [[TODO]] [[Today Focus]]}}}
- I have a fear and feeling uncomfortable with toilet. It haunts me and makes me feel hard to relax with.
- I'm thinking about how to manage the ideas that I want to write (where to store/ keep track/ link it with my MOC?) [[Creating phase]]
- I'm not really sure how to hanld the Productivity System yet
    - The pilot section for me is about storing my life's direction and manage my life intention as well as what I will need to complete and execute
        - And the guiding principle to make sure that I'm on the right track
    - The plane is all about how to execute and complete the order effectively
    - The engineer section is about ensuring I can achieve my life direction in an efficient way, and also about checking and upgrade the system. It will not hold the guiding principle about the whole system. 
- [[admin tasks]] are the big topic to explore about [[reducing friction]] and create fluid for the main work.
    - Some examples of admin tasks
        - set-up
        - preparing materials
        - preparing next actions
        - planning
        - process/ worklfow
        - end goal - measure of success
        - list of small tasks/steps
        - clarity of thinking
- For developing workflow, I think that's it starts to clear about the process [[Workflow MOC]] 
    - Weekly review and planning what I need to focus on the next week
        - I need to clear about when I finish what is close the loop for this week.
    - Each morning I will take a look and plan what I will resolve this day
        - The importance is I have a clear picture of what I need to resolve and how I will resolve them. [[The Plane MOC]] I need to know when I finish it and close the loop of that day.
    - The flow will be
    - Most important steps for the above flow are:
        - weekly review and planning
            - Cleaning the cluster and shaping what's emerge
                - Writing tasks freely on inbox task
                - Preparing what I need to consume and process for the next week
                - Split into different projects and master projects
            - Planning for next week
                - Take projects or part of the projects that I want to complete this week to  [[Focus of the week]] section.
        - daily planning
            - When doing daily planning, I will clear the tasks that I completed and put more tasks from [[Focus of the week]] to [[Today Focus]].
- Now I'm still not clear about clarity with the tasks and what I need to do, this will be main focus for tomorrow. It's about [[inner clarity]]
