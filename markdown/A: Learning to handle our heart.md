- If you can't handle your heart, you can't handle life, because life will always touch your heart. This message is really affecting me and help me to know the hard truth that in order to truly live, I have to live is learning to handle our heart. 
    - Heart are energy center that giving off the vibration of [[emotions]] based on the interaction between shakti - the energy flow and the samskaras that we stored inside.
    - Most of the time, we can only feel the disturbed emotions 
        - because life always trigger our unhandled samskaras 
        - Or it will come up naturally by the inner energy flow push it out
    - And the reason we stored it is that it's not easy to feel from the beginning so we resist and keep it there.  But what stored with pain will come up with pain, what stored with hurt will come up with hurt.
    - However, if we learned to handle and let go these samskaras, the flow of energy will become clean and smooth again, so that instead of feeling the disturbances, we can start to simply experience the clean flow of energy that's feeding us with joy, happiness, excitement, esctacy.... 
    - This is the difference between a sick heart and a healthy heart.
