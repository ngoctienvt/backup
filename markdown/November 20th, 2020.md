- I dreamt that I joined a class on TGM. I don't feel natural and feel that I have many judgements, resistances, and sense of superiority because I may know the truth, and they are not. I know what is right and they don't. [[humility]]
- Today focus:
    - Learning productivity class
    - Completing edit course 8
    - Developing Workflow and PKDS
- I started to have a vertical structure about [[level of thinking]] related to [[horizons of focus]], review, and zoom-in or zoom-out [[point of view]]
    - [[horizons of focus]]
        - Tasks and actions are what I will focus to complete on daily basis, and these things help me to progress on my projects
        - projects are a big picture of tasks and actions that I will need to work on
        - While projects will be about make sure me to move forward certain unfolding direction and develop myself over the course - it will be leverage my process or system goal
        - and while I keep doing good on improving my process or system goal, my vision and purpose in life start to clearer to see how my life is unfolding. 

It's still unpredictable, but the road is much more clearer about who I am become to. My vision and purpose will be the [[Life Polestar]] that will help me align my goal/projects/tasks and actions in a way that serve my life purpose when I aware of it. [[alignment]]  
    - And the level of my review will be based on these level of focus [[reflection]] [[horizons of reflection]]
        -  a daily review will be more about what I did today, and what I noticed about myself, or what's emerging - noticing what's emerging
        - while a weekly review is about project levels. It's about collecting what I want to do, to learn - capturing what's emerging to work on
        - and a monthly review is about working to improve my process or system so that I will live much more effective, reducing friction, cleaning big stuff - learning to be efficient
        - a mid year review is about seeing the direction that I'm moving on and work on top-down bottom to make sure that everything's [[on the right track]]
    - and I saw that there is something emerge about [[horizon of mastery]]
        - to mastery something, it's also start with a kind of outline picture - shaping
        - then there will be important components that I need to master - core components
        - then there could be improve and optimize it over time - creation/ flexibility
        - My [[training method]] would be about focus on the first two stages - it's more concrete and less abstract
    - [[bottom-up approach]] will help us to aware and notice what's the direction that universe wants us to do, while [[top-down approach will help us to align our life to that direction and serve it in an efficient way. The important is not about efficiency, it's about the willingness to embrace life, step on the direction and then moving on that direction efficiently. [[focus on what matters]]
- These few days has been a productive day for me. I managed to complete 2 courses, start to emerge my own productivity system to navigate my life fearlessly. I feel so thankful and grateful for everything that I have today. Namaste.
