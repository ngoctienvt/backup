- [[ðŸŒ±One Step Planning]]
    - When I write about What I need to have a fulfill year, I start to see what I want to complete or resolve, they maybe small, maybe big, but at least they give me a direction.
    - Then I start to see what's the meaning behind these things? This give me a sense about where I'm going, and why I'm going that way.
        - This step also needs to have some considerations to check about the PURPOSES and the THINGS I want to complete, before going on detail.
    - Next, I start to write down what are next steps that I could start do. This give me clear about what needs to handle now. However, it's not easy to execute yet, because I can know what I need to complete, but I don't know how to complete it yet.
        - Therefore, they are not executable yet and still create certain resistances to move forward.
        - Some of smaller steps need to happen here to make them executable
            - The questions will focus on "How I can do this...?" or "What I need to be able..."
                - It's important to see the gaps and know how to close the gap gradually.
    - I wonder where principles and support systems will come here. 
    - The expected outcome of this planning are
        - Have a clear vision about what I want to create or to complete
        - Have clear actionable next steps with systematic order that I can just do now without wondering
            - This maybe need to complement by the support system needed (resources, coaching, mentor, consult,...)
        - Have a structure for reflection and celebration and how the process will occur until I reach end goals. 
        - Knowing how to identify principles and bring them into the process
        -
