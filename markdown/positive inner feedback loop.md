- [[self-generated motivation]] for [[snowball]] effect
    - Instead of trying to go to the next step, we will naturally move on when the current step are ready for the next step. [[readiness]]
        - For example, [[evergreen garden]] 
            - When the trees are gathered enough, we will start developing a need to condense them naturally, because we will feel that they are clustering and need to resolve when the materials are ready. [[clustering]] [[positive inner feedback loop]]
    - [[joy of development]]
        - For example, [[deeper understanding]]
            - instead of writing what we are taught without processing, write it in our own word or own understanding can give us feedback to how much we understand
- [[built-in feedback loops]]
    - The feedback are built in the process itself instead of an external things
