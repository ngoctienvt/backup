    - research
    - training

- [[bottom-up evolution]] is the way of approach life from the current starting point and working from that level to move up the [[soul evolution]] process in a natural way. However, if there is no [[intention]], the soul will easily get distracted and live in a sleep state or accept the lower life.

    - [[coaching]]
- [[soul evolution]] will need to work on both level to have a [[intention]] to aim to from [[top-down boundary]] and close the gap by [[bottom-up evolution]]. This [[progressive approach]] of [[soul evolution]] includes both [[top-down boundary]] and [[bottom-up evolution]] that complement each other to help the soul evolve and live the truth as [[natural progression]] as possible.
    - This [[progressive approach]] actually looks like how our brain behaves with interconnected but no rigid hierarchy and work like [[merging]] process to evolve the soul.
    - This [[progressive approach]] also have 3 important point:
        - Intention
        - Available or accumulate
        - Now
