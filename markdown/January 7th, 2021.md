- My today focus
    - Learning Super Brain
    - Work with [[@D∆∞∆°ng Th·ªã Huy·ªÅn]] to develop more the PKDS system
    - Take time to handle the new experiences from my teeth
    - Start to work on my own [[üå±Life Navigation Map]]
- I noticed that my training course about [[üå±Training Course - Effortless Growth]] will base on
    - [[üå±Life Navigation Map]]
    - Each components of the map will have different principles and techniques to focus on
    - The whole map will have a system or process to handle the change and what emerge
    - In the Action Board, this is the most complicated with many things going on
- [[Daily Worthy Stories]] Huy·ªÅn. Park. Casual Walk. Pancake. Wonder if I should call her or not?
- I‚Äôm not wrong with everyone. I‚Äôm only wrong with myself, because I‚Äôm not taking fully responsibilities for my growth and my state of being [[generative language]]
- I noticed that there will be certain [[intrinsic qualities]] that based of my soul evolution, and from these qualities, I developed human learned abilities like languages, imagination, critical thinking, coaching...
    - These intrinsic qualities are far more important than current knowledges, skills, external stuffs, money, what we gathered/ owned, techniques - learned stuff. 
- My whole next life chapter is directing myself to the truth that I clarify, not based on my thoughts, because they are based on my inner state and this is varied and not reliable. [[truth-oriented]]
    - Through this I will be able to fully thrive and live fully, and know how to let go what is untruth or fear-based, and unblock true love, compassion and true wisdom.
    - Truth is not depend on what changes, but rather based on what always true and non-context (situation, people, things, beliefs, knowledges...) dependent.
        - I need to put my center on myself, this is the only thing stable. Everything outside that will change, life change, people change, situation change, emotions change, thoughts change...
- There is a big major bridge or connection that hold the impersonal and personal part together perfectly is WHO WE ARE and WHAT WE WANT TO SERVE is INTER-DEPENDENT. [[inter-related]]
    - This means that there are no perfect way to do anything, because there will always exist 2 variables, and one is totally varied from person to person. Just as how I think, my strengths, my tendencies, my consioucness, my ability levels are totally different with other people, and what I concern to serve is also based on my personal view, experiences, state of being so there will be never 2 people totally agree on the samething. [[individual uniqueness]]
-  As I start to create how I tend to learn, I noticed that it will be effective if I could 'Create Fast, Test Often'. [[üå±My Learning Styles]]
- [[Cultivates trust and safety]] [[Evokes awareness]] It's important to use clients language to recap, reflect, and show empathy to their situation. Then it's important to ask them provoking questions to bring them to higher-truth and what's possible beyond their current stage.
    - It's like accepting the darkness and then inviting for seeking light.
- Today I start to feel that my life is coming a new page. The page about a whole new person emerging inside of me, the person that I want to become but not as a main character, but supplement character. Because I developed my main character enough now, so that I can integrate that new part into me without fearing losing myself.
- [[Happiness from experiences]] The word to show that we purely interested for the sake of experiences, not for solve our inner problems by external things are CURIOUS AND INTERESTED (wanna try to simply know how it feels whether how good or bad it is)
- [[Happiness from growth]] The keyword for this is SATISFACTION
- [[Happiness from services]] The keyword for this is JOY, happy,...
