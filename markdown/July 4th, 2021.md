- [[üìùWeekly Review]]
    - Highlights:
        - I start to learn to truly design a workshop session in my own way. It's not easy, but I will learn to become masterful overtime in a way that focus on the process and the improvement, rather than the outcomes.
        - It's fun to talk with Th·∫£o, I don't know what this relationship means to be, but it's a challenge for me to clean myself so that the relationship becomes pure and not affected by personal needs.
        - I learn a lot about my need for control and attach while I'm doing the workshop. I feel that I'm not easy to lean back, let the process take care of itself and be the rider in it. I still have a strong need for the outcome, the approach, and not able to relax to respect the reality and the unique of the person enough.
        - I start to comeback to coaching in a much more deeper way. I notice that I want to utilize what I learned recently about designing workshop to create a co-learning coaching group. 
            - This will help me to improve my skillset by learning deeper, and practicing designing skill as the same time.
        - The ability to be pure, relax, simple, and empty is a challenge for me - but if I got it, it will become a life that wonder. I will need to work more about this.
        - I found out that a Job Aid that break things down is tremendous help for me, as I have a tendency to see things as one, and this makes thing become hard. If I'm able to learn to break things down in a systematic way and see things as many different notes rather than one will be a tremendous growth for me.
