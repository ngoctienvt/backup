- Some of my ideas for this are:
    - deleting the old notes that fully used its value
    - carefully choosing the keywords and ideas
    - try to link the ideas in a specific way instead of broad categories. Or if there is a broad category, then work top-down to [[breakdown]] them to all the ideas or topics related.
- What's the real concern that I worry here?
    - I worry if I lost the value of my writing notes. [[values]]
    - I worry if my Roam Research becomes cluster and I need to reread too many notes, even the one that got used instead of just working on the new things that I haven't resolved. [[clustering]]
