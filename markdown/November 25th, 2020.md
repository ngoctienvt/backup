- I start to come back to my practices and my main work. Somehow there will be different types of tasks that I will do each day [[types of tasks]]
    - There will be [[habit tasks]] which I will do specific task every single day like
        - Morning and evening meditation 
            - for spiritual practices
        - Consuming certain books or materials
            - for constant newness
        - Morning journal 
            - for clarify thoughts and intention
        - Daily review and weekly review 
            - for zoom-out perspective and optimization
    - There will be [[project tasks]] that based on my active projects. These tasks will need a specific system to handle and organize them, so that I can just simply work on and not much friction.
    - There will be some [[schedule tasks]] that are
        - Coaching
        - Training
        - Meeting someone
        - Going somewhere...
    - I will need some [[Life's Guiding Principles MOC]] to keep me on the right track
        - Handling [[habit-formed will]]
        - Flexibility with uncertainty
        - Managing entropy
- Today I learned that learn to dance in [[the middle way]] is happening on everything. It's not just about balance, it's about a central point from that I navigate my life from zoom-in or zoom-out effectively, and because I'm working on the middle, so there is no true bottom line or top ceiling.
- I noticed that my tools will be different but they will be invole when I'm clearing my overall [[ðŸ§­Productivity System MOC]] system first. [[tools]] [[Support System MOC]]
    - For instance, Roam Research would be mainly for me to work on main knowledge development tasks such as
        - Roam Research
            - Collecting high-quality input, 
            - Processing internal knowledge
            - Unifying thoughts, ideas, and outline them
        - Notion
            - Store raw input
            - Write complete articles and publish them externally
        - Not clear yet
            - There is a grey area here that's I'm not clear yet. It's about [[Evergreen notes]], I'm not really sure how to organize it and actually about how it will develop and mature yet.
            - For tasks and projects management, I think I will test to use Roam now, because Roam is where my main workplace, and I don't want to switch out of it too much.
- [[my quotes]] Judgments come from personal expectations, while constructive feedbacks may emerge from unconditional appreciation.
