- I feel that my brain is running too much, and trying to condensing thoughts from top-down, and it puts me into so much pressure. I start to realize that this pressure makes me think too much unnecessary. The [[top-down]] pressure is good for helping me to have a direction for what I want to do but it's also put me into a difficult situation because the [[bottom-up approach]] thinking is not enough [[materials]] to easily convert to solve the top-down problem yet.
- Today my main tasks are:
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Editing video 2
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Bottom-up and condensing thoughts to produce top-down articles about Roam Research
- I realized some frustration that when I edited in a publish post, because it didn't fix in the [[original source]]. It will be much better if I fixed them at root cause, learned what's wrong, and dealt with them at once, instead of jumping back-and-forth and edit mindlessly. [[intentional refining]] [[work at the root]]
- I feel that I enjoy the process of writing or building the product [[building process]], but I didn't enjoy the process of cleaning, refining, and polishing it. I feel completed when I completed to say everything I want, but it's not the end. [[self-fulfilled]] This is only for myself fulfillment, and it didn't count other people into it. [[refining and delivering process]]
    - The process will be several steps:
        - Gather the thoughts
        - Choose the intention
        - Building
        - Refining and delivering
        - Feedback loop
- I also feel that my thoughts are much cleaner, and less think to say now when it focuses on things. I need to relax more and have [[proper resting]] to recharge my mental energy.
- I feel that I still have the need for [[recognition]] from other people, and it went together with my intention to help other people become better, this make me self-justify for myself instead of clearly split them into 2 parts and don't put [[expectations]] or pressure into other people. [[spiritual growth]] [[emotions]]
- I feel the restlessness inside of me to get what I want. It's still controls me and I need to learn to handle this. The big lesson here is to release any need that emerges inside of me. Now is the need for attention and recognition [[spiritual growth]] [[personal needs]] and learn to [[self-fulfilled]] instead.
- Meditation and [[surrender]] is still the highest practice that I can have to release the part that not okay with the reality and to handle the urge to fix things inside by external solutions. [[inner urge]]
- I also start to less have new thoughts and feel I accumulated a lot of thoughts that want to condense into a deeper understanding and [[pressure makes diamonds]] first. 
- [[intention]] some of the topics that I want to spend my energy next is:
    - {{[[DONE]]}} [[top-down boundary]] and [[bottom-up approach]] 
    - "{{[[DONE]]}} How to use [[Roam Research]] to evolve my mind effectively"
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Summarizing [[spiritual knowledge]] from Michael Singer teaching
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Releasing the samskaras about the need for attention and recognition, [[fear]] and nurture [[self-fulfilled]]
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Start to work on [[generated language]]
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Start to work on [[intention]]
    - 
- [[self-fulfilled]] is learn to release the blockages, the urges that want to solve the inner problem with short-term external solutions and able to fulfill myself with all that personal need. The keyword is to [[learn]] how to [[work at the root]] and not satisfy with the [[temporary solutions]]. It requires the attitude to see what's really work and what's just a short-term solutions. 
    - What's seem to be a solution is different with What's really solution
