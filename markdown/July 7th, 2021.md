- [[Structure Coaching activities]]
    - The idea of creating Structure Coaching activities for participants to support each other seems interesting. It's not easy to instruct and execute though, but I think there will be a way to do this properly, especially in the long run class, because people will have opportunities to improve.
    - Some initial ideas is a person will share their stories, and each person will be instruct to do a different competencies in coaching.
        - Like a person will do a direct communication to make a comment, share an observation, share a point of view, and following up with a simple question.
        - Or a person will do powerful questions to ask questions that provoke the person thinking or challenge their beliefs.
    - There will be some rules or principles to help people facilitate the process properly like
        - Keep silence after the question and let the coachee announce
        - Make sure that you own your observations, and make sure that the questions are helpful for the coachee rather than satisfy your own curiosity.
    - Or there will be a reflection activities to sum up what has been discuss and next step for further exploration

- I feel that my mind become so hyperactive when there is so many things that provoke the creativity. And I’m not able to embrace and facilitate them yet. It’s important for me to learn to embrace and calm down the mind, so that’s even though I’m excited for what could be. I can always peace at present and not feeling any attachments or pressure.
- I also notice that I start to think and care more about Thao. It’s need to be address for pure and not personal relationship. if possible, I want to be a good partner with her, and if we can go further, it’s ok. But if not, it’s also fine totally.
- I realize that coaching and spirituality has been a big part of me, and that leads to the fact that I’m living in a way that trust the process, and care more about the inner rather than the outer. I don’t have a big need to teach other, but rather I want to help other become a better version of themselves and acquire skills if needed in a most natural and integrated way.
    - That’s why I care more about how process happen rather than forcing the surface outcomes.
