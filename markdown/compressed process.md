- Why?
    - The main meaning of [[compressed process]] is to help you achieve [[deeper understanding]] about the topics, concepts, so you can merge your scattering thoughts to a pearl of wisdom. 
        - [[compressed understanding]]
        - prepare high-quality materials or tools for generating output
- How to organize compressed information?
    - The information will be organized in a way that can edit or add-on later, or support [[compressed process]] or support the next [[compressed process]].
    - The concept will be isolated by itself or could be live in a bigger concept to make it wholer, but understanding will be centered around the idea of the topic concept.
        - For example, if I have a bottom-up evolution concept, then I will have a progressive approach that cover the bottom-up evolution concept. And I want to keep them relate but separate at the same time? How will I solve this?
            - In the bottom-up evolution concept, I will work on everything related directly to this and develop my understand it over time.
            - While in the progressive approach, the bottom-up evolution concept is just an application to this approach, not about fully understand the concept separately.
- The condensing process:
    - collecting meaningful data (summarize, key take-aways, new awareness, new understanding...)
    - resolving [[Expanding questions]] and inbox
    - structuring understandings
    - clean clustering and re-organize information if needed
