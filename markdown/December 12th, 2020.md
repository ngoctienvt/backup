- [[weekly reflection]]
    - Highlights of the week:
        - My mind is starting to clearer and much more clarity about [[true relationship]], [[ðŸŒ±Training Course - Effortless mastery]], [[getting in touch with reality]]
        - Many new concepts that I learned this week help me to concrete my thinking and knowledge much more. This next week will be an exciting week to know what they will emerge when I'm deepen my understanding about them, and connect them together.
        - I feel so much peaceful and happy now as I can see that's I'm becoming better each day, each week, and I can let go more and more stuff inside of my heart over time.
        - I also noticed that last week my health was heavily impacted due to I feel hard to sleep. I will work more on this on the next week so that's I could use my bed time better and effective. [[energy management]]
        - I learned that [[end goal]] is very important, because if we focus to means goal, we may never reach the end goal, because we work indirectly to get it. And because we work indirectly, we put more condition for ourselves to get our end goals. 
        - I learned that I'm not good at interacting with people in daily life situation, I'm favor meaningful conversations rather than simply sharing the joy with each other. [[true relationship]]
        - I start to see the relationship between [[Level of expertise]] and [[Bloom's taxonomy]] as in order to move up level of expertise, we will need to work more on analyze, evaluate and creation stage.
            - [[ðŸŒ±PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System]] serve as a way to solidify our creation to work more on later.
        - My [[Life's Guiding Principles MOC]] is also that I will not force things to happen, but focus on myself and let things happen naturally. For example, I will develop and do my main work, instead of trying to persuade or attach with other people for something that I think will good for them.
- [[ðŸŒ±Training Course - Effortless mastery]]
    - My visualization image is a container that holds piece off information that wait for me to analyze and create my own knowledge. [[knowledge storage]]
- My intention to [[serving the demand of reality]] is helping people aim higher instead of helping them avoid what they don't way or achieve what they want.
    - Want is a word that easily to be misunderstood, I want to help a way to rephrase this properly. [[Want]]
        - I want is easier to come from our samskaras (lower-self or lower-thought) that serve the personal self rather than come from the witness consciouss and higher-thought that nurture over time to serve the reality.
- While we focus on the tools or the way, we easily lost ourselves and operate ourselves around it, but this is a limited way to live life. Always aim to true [[end goal]] will ensure that we always focus on the right thing, and require us to grow, learn, adapt properly with the unfolding reality instead.
    - Start with limitless consciousness, end with limitless end goal.
- I noticed that with [[Bloom's taxonomy]]
    - There will be different elements on each stage
        - Creating maybe natural with emergence, but can also actively create with different strategies
        - Analyzing will have different ways of analyze. 
        - The difference between applying and understanding is applying is about reality situation, understanding maybe only on simulated situation or classrom situation
