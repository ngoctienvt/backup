- Application or project will withdraw the concept to serve proper contextual usages so that the intention will be achieved.
    - And what if my progressive approach could become a isolated concept itself and an application for other things
        - So my mind here now is concept will be isolated by itself, but related to other concept
        - While application will require the interaction and contextual usages of them. Like I can make a journaling training, and the application of the program will need to have the progressive approach concept, so that instead of building the program on progressive approach, I build them on my journaling training project page instead.
