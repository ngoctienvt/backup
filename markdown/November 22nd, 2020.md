- I noticed that my workflow, task & project management, and weekly/daily planning will be tightly related to each other. [[The Pilot MOC]]
    - My [[Workflow MOC]] will let me know what type of task that I want to work on
        - Types of tasks
            - Consuming
            - Processing
            - Unifying
            - Releasing...
            - Thinking...
    - Task & project management will store list of tasks and projects that I want to focus on.
        - Weekly planning I will plan about projects and schedule activities
            - [[project management]] Area of focus or projects will have different stages to work on
                - [[Learning phase]]
                - [[Developing phase]]
                - [[Creating phase]]
        - Daily planning I will plan about the specific tasks that I want to focus on that day
- [[horizons of spiritual growth]]
    - no-self - universal consiousness
    - serving and raising the unfolding reality
    - handle high-hanging fruits
    - handle low-hanging fruits (weather, past experiences, limiting beliefs...)
    - nurture presence or centering on the seat of awareness
    - nurture desire and willingness to free yourself and live a surrender life 
- I felt that I'm starting to release more and more my attachments due to the awareness that everything has its own level of development. I can't let my own samskaras to put my standards and expectations to other people. They are what I need to let go, not what I need to reinforce on. [[samskaras]]
-  I noticed that's when offer [[@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh]] to buy for me a book, there is a need inside of me that doesn't want to waste and use it effectively, while I also want to somehow have it influence her in a good way somehow indirectly. It's my big lesson to let go my [[need for efficient]] first, then it's simply a way for me to support her indirectly.
