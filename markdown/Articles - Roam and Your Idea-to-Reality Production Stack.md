    - The low-hanging fruits were meeting notes, to do lists and noting down ideas on ongoing projects and operations.
    - Tools for thought are not only for academics. They are also for those of us whose calling in life is to bring ideas to reality.
    - If we are to be deliberate in designing our workflow, we have to ask: what should be in our idea-to-reality production stack? 
        - Note that our stacks are built not only with software, 
        - but also the mental frameworks that we use with Roam and other apps.
    - The idea-to-reality production stack gives us a language to describe the shape of our work.
    - The work of intellectuals is to generate and grow ideas. The job of a project manager is to bring an idea to reality. The work of entrepreneurs span the three stages.

    - ### Frameworks for Generating Ideas
        - **The Zettelkasten** is a note-taking and organization system invented by the ultra-prolific social theorist Niklas Luhmann.
        - A **Mind Garden** is a collection of interlinked and publicly available notes. A good place to start is [this introduction](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) by Anne-Laure Le Cunff and [this drawing](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1279798483218767877/photo/1) by Maggie Appleton:

        - **Morning Pages** is from [The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron](https://amzn.to/2D36fAj). It is part of the creative recovery program outlined in the book. You write three pages of raw unrestrained sentences every morning during the program.
        - **Artist Dates** is the other component of Julia Cameron’s creative recovery program. It is simply going outside to do something fun or interesting by yourself. I prefer to call it **Serendipity Walks**.
        - **treat ideas as beings from another realm whose purpose is to manifest themselves in this world.**
        - They need a human partner to do this.
        - [Self-authoring](https://www.selfauthoring.com/) is a process created by a group of psychologists to systematically examine one’s past experiences (past authoring), strengths and and weaknesses (present authoring) and goals (future authoring).
    - ## Frameworks for Making Ideas Realistic
        - **Lean Startup** is presented as a systematic way to validate novel business models. In practice, you also generate a lot of ideas as you get out of the building and test whether your idea has legs.
        - [Design Thinking](https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/what-is-design-thinking) is a user-centric set of processes for solving problems.
        - **Focus Group Discussion** is a classic process used in the marketing world to check whether a new product or service fits a certain demographic.
        - These processes were made for teams. The only idea validation process I’ve encountered that **seems** to be for individuals is the [Ask Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=694RE8nDl-8). It is a systematic way to segment your market and customize your messaging for each segment.
    - ## Frameworks for Making Ideas Real
        - project is the work that needs to be done to bring an idea to reality.
        - [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) is one of the most well-known task management systems. The system is explained in the book of the same name by David Allen. GTD unfortunately doesn’t work for me. It makes my present self feel like a slave of my past self.
        - [Building a Second Brain (BASB)](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/), I suspect, is Tiago Forte’s personal idea-to-reality production stack. Its task management component is inspired by GTD. It also has components that help one generate ideas and make those ideas realistic (eg, keeping ideas moving and sharing them with the world).
        - I recently attended a [Goal Crafting Intensive](https://complice.co/event/gci2020midyear) by [Complice](https://complice.co/). Going deep into **crafting goals** is one way to start making your ideas real. The central tension of goal crafting is that for deep achievements, you need your past self to coordinate the work of your present and future selves through commitment to a vision. However, your present and future selves almost always know better than your past self who crafted the goal.
    - ## Software for Your Idea-to-Reality Production Stack
        - My strong opinion on project management training is that it should be centered around project management frameworks and software, which are solutions to problems project managers are hired to solve.
        - The work of project conceptualization and planning is mainly that of imagination: reimagining reality and imagining the pathway to that new reality.
- My takeaways::
    - A framework is a behind-the-scene approach that could be used together to execute certain projects or end goals.
    - Software is the support of the framework.
    - Start with goal, or what I want. Then developing the framework related to it. Then find the tools to support the process.
