    - The low-hanging fruits were meeting notes, to do lists and noting down ideas on ongoing projects and operations.
    - Tools for thought are not only for academics. They are also for those of us whose calling in life is to bring ideas to reality.
    - If we are to be deliberate in designing our workflow, we have to ask: what should be in our idea-to-reality production stack? 
        - Note that our stacks are built not only with software, 
        - but also the mental frameworks that we use with Roam and other apps.
    - The idea-to-reality production stack gives us a language to describe the shape of our work.
    - The work of intellectuals is to generate and grow ideas. The job of a project manager is to bring an idea to reality. The work of entrepreneurs span the three stages.

    - ### Frameworks for Generating Ideas
        - **The Zettelkasten** is a note-taking and organization system invented by the ultra-prolific social theorist Niklas Luhmann.
        - A **Mind Garden** is a collection of interlinked and publicly available notes. A good place to start is [this introduction](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) by Anne-Laure Le Cunff and [this drawing](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1279798483218767877/photo/1) by Maggie Appleton:

        - **Morning Pages** is from [The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron](https://amzn.to/2D36fAj). It is part of the creative recovery program outlined in the book. You write three pages of raw unrestrained sentences every morning during the program.
        - **Artist Dates** is the other component of Julia Cameron’s creative recovery program. It is simply going outside to do something fun or interesting by yourself. I prefer to call it **Serendipity Walks**.
        - **treat ideas as beings from another realm whose purpose is to manifest themselves in this world.**
        - They need a human partner to do this.
        - [Self-authoring](https://www.selfauthoring.com/) is a process created by a group of psychologists to systematically examine one’s past experiences (past authoring), strengths and and weaknesses (present authoring) and goals (future authoring).
