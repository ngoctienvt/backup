- I felt that I started to have a new whole door to explore and to learn from. It excites me but overwhelms me at the same time. The reason is I still have a tendency to rush through, to have now,... I start to rush myself to that dopamine, rather than being center and let things unfold slowly in a [[bottom-up approach]]. [[unattachment centering]]
- I noticed that I still need to work more on my [[workflow]], I still not clear what I need to do, so I just keep my mind wander and let it sink into the thoughts, emotions, and feelings. I'm not actively [[unattachment centering]] yet.
- My [[point of focus]] is rather unclear, scatter, 
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Learning to have a clarity mind and a clear point of focus will be one of my important task for next week [[inner clarity]]
- [[weekly reflection]] 
    - My last week has been a week with new inspirations and directions. I started to feel that I will develop myself to become a thinker and a blogger to serve the world by my wisdom. I also find out something called [[instructional design]] so that I could develop myself, and [[learning facilitator]] to support other people learning effectively.
    - I noticed that my [[unattachment centering]] is challenged because of many disturbances that emerge. I will spend most of my time today to work on this.
    - [[humility]], [[true love]]. [[inner clarity]] and [[unattachment centering]] are three quality that is my [[point of focus]] currently.  
    - [[workflow]] [[PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System MOC]] is my current focus of working, followed by [[coaching]].
    - I can really feel that I'm becoming more and more clarity, more freedom, and much more cleaner inside. Even though sometimes I will lose myself, I still can easily get my center back. [[unattachment centering]]
    - My feeling about time now is much slower, because I go through much more transformation in a short period of time, and it happens continuously, everything around me and inside me also change significantly without me even truly realizing how it has been changed. [[time awareness]]
- I wonder how I will handle my tag when I start to develop MOC and centralized notes. [[Personal Knowledge Development cycle]]
- [[Who lights the stars]]
    - Who lights the stars last night?
Who shines the sun. x2 
To this one I gave my life, till my days as done.
To this one I gave my heart, till we merge as one.
    - Who lights the stars last night?
Who shines the sun. x2 
To this one I gave my life, till my days as done.
To this one I gave my heart, till we merge as one.
    - Who beats my heart
Who raise this one
Who lights the stars?
Who shines the sun
Who laid this one
- There are still many strong [[samskaras]] that able to pull me out if I'm not aware of it. At least I can always notice them and keep melting them so they will become softer and softer over time. My [[inner flow of energy]] become cleaner over time.
