- I felt that I started to have a new whole door to explore and to learn from. It excites me but overwhelms me at the same time. The reason is I still have a tendency to rush through, to have now,... I start to rush myself to that dopamine, rather than being center and let things unfold slowly in a [[bottom-up approach]]. [[unattachment centering]]

- My [[point of focus]] is rather unclear, scatter, 
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Learning to have a clarity mind and a clear point of focus will be one of my important task for next week [[inner clarity]]

    - My last week has been a week with new inspirations and directions. I started to feel that I will develop myself to become a thinker and a blogger to serve the world by my wisdom. I also find out something called [[instructional design]] so that I could develop myself, and [[learning facilitator]] to support other people learning effectively.
    - I noticed that my [[unattachment centering]] is challenged because of many disturbances that emerge. I will spend most of my time today to work on this.
    - [[humility]], [[true love]]. [[inner clarity]] and [[unattachment centering]] are three quality that is my [[point of focus]] currently.

- I wonder how I will handle my tag when I start to develop MOC and centralized notes. [[Personal Knowledge Development cycle]]

- Today I just want to talk with [[@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh]] as two friends and not to solve anything, but to feel, to understand, and let her be herself. Let her feel seen, feel heard and feel understood, to be express her inner state, to share her life, to feel that's there is a person who always stand by her side unconditionally, always curious about her, and always want the best for her life unconditionally. It's not a reciprocal communication, but rather a deep connection between two souls to feel each other heart. [[unconditional relationship]]
- Let other people feel that's they are important. Let them feel seen, feel heard, and feel understood. [[coaching]] [[unconditional relationship]]
