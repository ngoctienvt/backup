- I noticed that I still feel there are some [[samskaras]] and some thoughts that I feel as reasonable because it's what I used to identify with and it seems to be closer and look like me. But actually, it's not. 

When I keep letting it go, I start to become much more freedom, less judging and able to embrace other people more. I need to develop a trust to my true self, not my mind or my samskaras. And especially a wise understanding that whatever got hit is not me, just the stuff that I haven't able to handle yet.

Life is about learning to embrace, not judging.
- I noticed that I unconsciously easy to attach with the tools or methods that I found or invested on. This is not a good habit, because it will hinder me to what I truly want and get stuck by the tools. It became the tools shape me, instead of I shape myself. [[attachment]]
    - [[my quotes]] [[influence]]
We - the witness consciouss must be the one who shape ourselves and the one who solely we attach with. 

It's not we shape the environment, and the environment shapes us. It's about we are being ourselves, and the environment is being itself. 

We exist inter-related but independent at the same time.
- I feel so thankful when I found out [[Nick Milo]]. He helped me to realize my attachments and whether Roam or Obsidian, I will stop to care about the tools yet. I will identify what I truly want, how would be my process to work on it, then I will be considered the tool later. The tools are just [[support system]] that I will look for after I already have inner clarity, not the attachment by the samskaras that give me short-term pleasure.

        - from the nothingness of fleeting thoughts »» 
to the “somethingness” of a concrete note
    - Level 2
        - ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkeFhY_VgAA5HRb?format=jpg&name=900x900)
        - Notes start to link to other notes. Relationships are formed. This is basic Zettelkasten.
        - ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkeF4vaVkAE3GzY?format=jpg&name=large)
        - As we continue making connections, the system starts to come alive, almost naturally evolving itself.
        - ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkeHM8rU8AUnFmw?format=jpg&name=large)
        - The beauty of the direct link is that ideas emerge organically. The limitation is that you're always in the forest. 

Very often, you want a birds-eye view of these relationships. That's where EMERGENCE LEVEL 3 begins...
    - Level 3
        - The solution is to make higher-order notes—which are just "notes with primarily links to other notes".

Higher-order notes like MOCs (Maps of Content) serve countless purposes...
        - You can use MOCs to overcome "Mental Squeeze Points" & continue triumphantly w/ your ideas & projects.

Just "Assemble" links to notes in a new MOC. You offload the cognitive burden so you stay in creative Flow
            - ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkeJSX7U8AA2XmV?format=jpg&name=medium)
        - But the even more profound and next-level power of MOCs is to USE THEM AS RAPID IDEATION CHAMBERS.

I can't stress the superpower of this enough...

MOCs are IDEATION ACCELERATORS!   
            - ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkeJb-LVMAEaeoC?format=jpg&name=large)
        - And yes, most obviously, higher-order notes like MOCs can be used for navigational purposes (hence the "Map" nomenclature).
            - ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkeKo0nUUAA4JI1?format=jpg&name=medium)
        - With your MOCs, you are 80% of the way done to finalized CREATION!
            - ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkeQWTRVoAES5K0?format=jpg&name=large)
    - Level 4
        - At this next level of emergence: MOCs are linked to MOCs! Instead of a just having living systems (basic Zettelkasten)...

Now we have living ecosystems!
            - ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkeQ8WAU0AAXYQi?format=jpg&name=large)
        - This allows you to fly around your note library rapidly, organically getting UNFORCED BEHAVIOR-BASED SPACED REPETITION.

Now you have multiple MOCs that easily communicate and contribute to more fun-to-finalize CREATIONS!

How powerful is that?!

    - Level 5
        - Now, we get to the highest level of your Idea Emergence...Your HOME NOTE

It consolidates new higher-order notes w/ older, more mature higher-order notes.

The Home note is the beginning & the end. It is a launchpad & a homebase. It is your North Star.
            - ![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkeStGIVcAAkvcg?format=jpg&name=large)
        - At this level, your ideas have become like a relatively stable Planetary system. (someone else's PKM would be another planet btw).

It's your "Earth"

"All roads lead to HOME."
        - The Home note allows for top-down “Convergent” thinking like navigating and deliberate creating.

The Home note allows for bottom-up “Convergent” thinking by consolidating new forms of emergence.
