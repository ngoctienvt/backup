- I noticed that I still feel there are some [[samskaras]] and some thoughts that I feel as reasonable because it's what I used to identify with and it seems to be closer and look like me. But actually, it's not. 

When I keep letting it go, I start to become much more freedom, less judging and able to embrace other people more. I need to develop a trust to my true self, not my mind or my samskaras. And especially a wise understanding that whatever got hit is not me, just the stuff that I haven't able to handle yet.

Life is about learning to embrace, not judging.
