- I noticed that I still feel there are some [[samskaras]] and some thoughts that I feel as reasonable because it's what I used to identify with and it seems to be closer and look like me. But actually, it's not. 

When I keep letting it go, I start to become much more freedom, less judging and able to embrace other people more. I need to develop a trust to my true self, not my mind or my samskaras. And especially a wise understanding that whatever got hit is not me, just the stuff that I haven't able to handle yet.

Life is about learning to embrace, not judging.
- I noticed that I unconsciously easy to attach with the tools or methods that I found or invested on. This is not a good habit, because it will hinder me to what I truly want and get stuck by the tools. It became the tools shape me, instead of I shape myself. [[attachment]]
    - [[my quotes]] [[influence]]
We - the witness consciouss must be the one who shape ourselves and the one who solely we attach with. 

It's not we shape the environment, and the environment shapes us. It's about we are being ourselves, and the environment is being itself. 

We exist inter-related but independent at the same time.
- I feel so thankful when I found out [[Nick Milo]]. He helped me to realize my attachments and whether Roam or Obsidian, I will stop to care about the tools yet. I will identify what I truly want, how would be my process to work on it, then I will be considered the tool later. The tools are just [[support system]] that I will look for after I already have inner clarity, not the attachment by the samskaras that give me short-term pleasure.
