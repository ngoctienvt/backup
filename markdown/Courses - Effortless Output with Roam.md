- ### Choose your capstone
    - Next Steps for Your Capstone
        - You've got a bit of time before the rest of the videos come out and the live sessions start. So here's your homework:
        - **First: Choose Your Capstone. **Decide what your capstone project will be by choosing a question you want to answer, and what kind of deliverable you want that research to lead to.
        - **Second: Share Your Capstone**. Once you've decided what you'll focus on, share your capstone in the Effortless Output Circle community! There's a ton of other Roam users there who might have some recommended resources for you.
        - **Third: Tweet About It! **The Roam community on Twitter is really strong and would love to hear what you're working on. Share your capstone project on Twitter, and don't forget to tag @nateliason and @roamresearch.
        - Here's a sample tweet:
        - __Super excited to be exploring underwater basket weaving as my capstone project for the @roamresearch course with @nateliason Let me know if you have any good resources I should check out!__
        - **Fourth: Start Researching. **The more materials you collect before the capstone project starts, the more ready you'll be to dive in and hit the ground running. Start looking for books, articles, podcasts, anything else that will help you explore your capstone project. And don't forget to ask for ideas on Circle and Twitter!
    - My capstone project
        - [[journaling training]]
            - Deliverable:  a training course that support other to build their second brain and access their intellectual brain
    - Useful tools for research and learning
        - **Instapaper or Pocket**: Both are great tools for highlighting important passages as you're reading articles. Sign up for either one, and then start using them to read all the articles relevant for your capstone project and highlighting important things as you go.
        - **Kindle**: A great option for reading if you want to be able to easily highlight important passages as you go. If you're reading any books as part of your Capstone project, reading them on Kindle will make it easier to get your notes into Roam later.
        - **Airr Audio**: Airr is the best podcast player for active note taking. It lets you save audio highlights up to 45 seconds long that you'll later be able to reference and import into Roam, great if you want to listen to podcasts as part of your research process.
        - **Hypothesis**: Hypothesis is a tool for highlighting and annotating the web. If you don't want to save an article into Pocket or Instapaper before reading it, or if you just see something on the web you want to quickly save, it's a great tool. It's also fun for discussing articles with other readers.
        - **Readwise**: Readwise plugs into all the other tools on this list and lets you save your highlights in one place, and eventually, export them to Roam. This is going to become extremely useful when we start on the "Research" section of the course.

- ### My takeaways::
    - What I learned so far from this course are
        - inbox for unprocessed materials
            - daily notes - internal materials (thoughts, feelings, insights, journals...)
            - external materials - (books, articles, audio,...)
        - Metadata for create pre-defined information that I want to easy to re-discover and find back
            - Author
        - Usage of different type of blocks:
            - References for display information and remain single source of truth
            - Embed for directly edit in the current page
            - Alias for condense information and still reference back to the source.
        - Progressive Summarization 
            - This will mainly for external materials
            - I still don't have clear way to handle internal materials
    - I will work on to have my own synthesis and condensing process first. It will need to solve few big [[Expanding questions]]
        - How I can create a head page or evergreen head pages for condensing internal and external materials in an bottom-up approach? 
        - How will I handle the cluster of information so that I won't waste time to review the materials that I'm completely absorb?
            - Delete? Or query? Or filter? 
        - How I will organize my way of tagging and creating page?
            - [[contextual usages]]
    - The main guideline for me will be
        - centralizing on serving myself in the most natural way - not focusing on the  methods or techniques, but the end goals
        - integration of internal materials and external materials
        - fully personalized first
        - progressive development
        - understanding or the idea behind first, then the process or procedure come after that.
