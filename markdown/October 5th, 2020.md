- This morning I felt too tired because of all activities that I made last night. I slept late, masturbated, played games. These all activities drained my physical body too much that I lost in the dream and my will power is too weak to wake up. [[energy management]]
- {{[[DONE]]}} I will work about my [[energy management]] this week
- When I'm reading Light Novels, it's really struck me hard that the feeling of unfairness, the feeling of life too hard is still there with me. There is still a part inside of me that wants things to be easier and wants to trust something that happens for a good reason.  [[trust the process]] [[unfairness]]

What if there is no good reason? What if there is nothing to count on except me? Am I give up or am I taking all responsibilities for my own life? Am I do the best at I can or am I count on external things? [[independent]] [[willpower]] [[spiritual growth]] [[impersonal responsibilities]]

This is really a big [[life lessons]] for me about releasing all the dependent thoughts instead of fully count on myself and trust myself. The self that can't speak. No thoughts are more me than me. Trust the one that aware, not the thoughts that it aware. 
- This week focus:
    - {{[[DONE]]}} [[energy management]]
    - {{[[DONE]]}} condensing knowledge about deep coaching
    - {{[[TODO]]}} templates or thinking process 
- 
- [[coaching reflection]] I felt that my coaching started to lengthy and unclear focus. It felt broad and lengthy instead of clear, concise and deepen.
- [[Expanding questions]] How to organize information in Roam Research?

- Instead of thing how to organize Roam Research, it would be better if I find out how I can let the process build itself like how the life works. [[self-evolving process]]
