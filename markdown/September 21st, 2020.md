- I'm not interested in the idea that becomes a person who can do all the good things, but I'm interested in becoming a soul that can contain everything. [[soul evolution]]. 
    - When I can contain things, I will have my way of interacting with the world instead of following the action of other masters. They will not be the one who defines my behavior, but I will instead. [[soul uniqueness]] 
    - We can have similar [[soul evolution]] process but the quality and [[freewill]] of each soul is diffent.
    - Able to contain everything does not mean always easy and does not deal with things properly, but actually does with a [[conscious choice]] and [[helpful manner]]
-  The fact we can love or not is undiscussable, we can always have the feelings of love because it's inside of us. But whether it's conditional or unconditional is another realm of a discussion? [[unconditional]] [[conditional]]
- My [[training method]] need to be concern about creating a proper [[learning curve]] that suits all of the different people no matter their starting point is.

- Beauty is a personal soul experience, and if the soul can handle the objects and fully merge with it, the soul can start to really experience the nature of that object. This is a true beauty, not surface beauty. And everything has its own beauty, just some we are able to handle, and some we aren’t yet. [[beauty]]

By setting this intention, it makes the [[soul evolution]] process is much more natural and less pressure as it unfolds and progress slowly. It also helped me to focus on myself first, because when I’m not clear or grow enough, there is no [[conscious choice]] and [[trueself competency]] to do the great things. My intention start to merge.

- I also felt kind of [[uncomfortable]] and [[annoying]] about the problem that appears and I don't know how to handle it yet. [[emotions]] I want to become much more [[unattachment centering]] and develop a [[receiving attitude]] with the new things that I can learn to do and experience in the time on earth, instead of getting disturbance about it. [[spiritual growth]]
