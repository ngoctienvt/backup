- I felt that my practice for [[unattachment centering]] is starting to become better and better overtime. Sometimes I accumulate too much stress or samskaras that make the waves of thoughts is hard to handle, but I just keep come back and let go, I'm increasing my ability to being center no matter what the waves are. Because as long as I'm doing nothing, the mind will eventually return to the stillness by itself.

    - I'm not so sure what drives me to this, but I can feel that I still have the inspiration to share my work and my knowledge to support other people.
    - In the past, I can't maintain a process of high-quality output, so that it feels not natural to me and then I quit after a period of trying times.
    - However, now is the time I'm starting to build the flow to create truly personal high-quality output consistently, so I think I could do it.
    - The point is doing things in a surrender and bottom-up way, slowly I will get there, then I will do the next step. 
    - Now I need to build the [[workflow]] first.
- My today focus will be
    - Continue to build up my workflow process
    - Clearing my thoughts about what I'm aiming to do now
- 
- For the [[goal-clarification]], I feel that the way I write randomly is not structure properly, so there will be a step to restructure it in an proper way
    - It's very important to have [[zoom-out point of view]] instead of zoom-in too much to the tools 
    - The [[end goals]] need to be clarify clearly
        - The tools and methods or anything that I feel I should do or want to do need to be put in a way 
            - that does not hinder my focus on now and the end goals
        - Organizing or merging them in a way that I feel integrating and just working on them instead of splitting myself into different directions
        - Detailing what I'm needing to do next for each smaller point
        - Letting go what I don't need to focus now, until reflection later on.
- I felt that when I'm just working slowly like this, the pattern, the framework is starting to emerge by itself, and my job is only need to pickup it later, instead of focusing too much on it early. [[pattern recognition]]
- I noticed that I have an uncomfortable feeling when I hear people just want to talk. I have a [[judgment]] about them that it will not gonna work, or I have an attachment with my coaching as a better way to support other people. My [[point of focus]] has been focus on my tools and what I like to do, instead of support other people.
    - The way I'm talking is more about myself rather than that person. I'm trying to at least have benefits for myself and protect these benefits first. I don't want to do, to spend my effort without any sure compensation back. [[need for reciprocal]]
- I noticed that before I try to bring the output to other people, I need to work on myself perfectly first, as I'm the one who I could support first and will be the person who tests my own idea and intention. 

This kind of thinking will create a smaller boundary that helps me to focus easier and will work more effectively. [[self-experiment]] Iâ€™m narrowing myself so that I could focus more on the moment instead of thinking too much about what is not ready to emerge yet. By narrow to focus to support and experiment only in one person, that is me. I could learn to make my life become an example and check the actual usage of what I want to do and have my own feedback first. 
- [[experience indigestion]] is what happens for me and people nowadays as we have been in a loop of seeking
    - experiences to satisfy ourselves
    - incapable of digest past experiences
    - seek external experiences to solve inner sick-being
    - incapable of stand back and enjoy everything
