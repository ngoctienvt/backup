- I felt that my practice for [[unattachment centering]] is starting to become better and better overtime. Sometimes I accumulate too much stress or samskaras that make the waves of thoughts is hard to handle, but I just keep come back and let go, I'm increasing my ability to being center no matter what the waves are. Because as long as I'm doing nothing, the mind will eventually return to the stillness by itself.
- {{[[TODO]]}} Becoming an [[international blogger]]
    - I'm not so sure what drives me to this, but I can feel that I still have the inspiration to share my work and my knowledge to support other people.
    - In the past, I can't maintain a process of high-quality output, so that it feels not natural to me and then I quit after a period of trying times.
    - However, now is the time I'm starting to build the flow to create truly personal high-quality output consistently, so I think I could do it.
    - The point is doing things in a surrender and bottom-up way, slowly I will get there, then I will do the next step. 
    - Now I need to build the [[workflow]] first.
- My today focus will be
    - Continue to build up my workflow process
    - Clearing my thoughts about what I'm aiming to do now
- I have too many thoughts, things that I want to do recently [[goal-clarification]]
    - Creating a journal training to support people to 
        - Journaling their emotions and thoughts to identify the samskaras need to work with [[living from the place of surrender]]
            - Externalizing their thoughts for create a dis-identification to it
            - Merging their mind to live one life solution
        - Building a learning process and a personal knowledge management system to become wiser over time
        - Developing a systematic thinking to think in a truthful and helpful way
    - Creating a blog to share my knowledge for other person
    - Becoming a master coach
    - Becoming a master trainer about spiritual, coaching, and wisdom developing
    - Becoming a living example with a total surrender to the unfolding life - the surrender experiment
    - Trusting the process completely instead of worrying about money consistently
- For the [[goal-clarification]], I feel that the way I write randomly is not structure properly, so there will be a step to restructure it in an proper way
    - It's very important to have [[zoom-out point of view]] instead of zoom-in too much to the tools 
    - The [[end goals]] need to be clarify clearly
        - The tools and methods or anything that I feel I should do or want to do need to be put in a way 
            - that does not hinder my focus on now and the end goals
        - Organizing or merging them in a way that I feel integrating and just working on them instead of splitting myself into different directions
        - Detailing what I'm needing to do next for each smaller point
        - Letting go what I don't need to focus now, until reflection later on.
- I felt that when I'm just working slowly like this, the pattern, the framework is starting to emerge by itself, and my job is only need to pickup it later, instead of focusing too much on it early. [[pattern recognition]]
- I noticed that I have an uncomfortable feeling when I hear people just want to talk. I have a [[judgment]] about them that it will not gonna work, or I have an attachment with my coaching as a better way to support other people. My [[point of focus]] has been focus on my tools and what I like to do, instead of support other people.
    - The way I'm talking is more about myself rather than that person. I'm trying to at least have benefits for myself and protect these benefits first. I don't want to do, to spend my effort without any sure compensation back. [[need for reciprocal]]
