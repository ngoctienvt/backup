- So far the event I want to do in the Saturday about coaching is about how to inspire other people to see the roles of coaching in personal development. Development and growth does not need to be alone, frustrated, painful, confusing, but it could be much more enjoyable, satisfaction, and still challenging.
    - The main message I want to empower for people who join the event is about we don't have to be struggle alone and it's hard. We don't have to learn things the hard way, there are better ways to live life and it's better to have the right support that we need for the journey.
        - It's totally okay to receive support, because the main point of coaching is bring out the essence inside of you. The main job is about your growth, your happiness, your joy, and the coach is just be there to make the process become more clear, direct, and smoother. 
        - Of course it's important to receive the right support. And coaching is specially for supporting other people to go beyond their current self - not by forcing but by nurturing, raising, empowering, encouraging - inviting
    - Getting support is not weak, getting support is courage because of the willingness to show the vulnerable side and open to receive.
