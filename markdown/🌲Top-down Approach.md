- The role of [[ðŸŒ²Top-down Approach]] is 
    - gaining clarity about direction and big picture that emerge from [[ðŸŒ²Bottom-up Approach]]
        - [[personal end goals]] 
        - Seeing big picture or the direction [[big picture thinking]]
    - align things to serve the end goal or purpose effectively [[on the right track]]
    - creating space for exploring, experiment and learning without the fear of being wrong
        - [[soft-boundary]]
        - [[ðŸ§­Map of Contents]] [[bottom-line]]
        - The boundary need to be clear about what is okay to be keep open and what is not.
            - What is okay?
                - add-on information - are information that will be accumulated and condensed and restructred if it started to excess number 5.
                - [[direct-related connections]] are the connection that directly relate to its [[atomic concept]]. The [[direct-related connections]] can also become the [[atomic concept]] of other smaller connections
                    - The highest atomic thing would be me. [[trueself]] Anything else is just my relationship with them.
                - Limited direct connection - temporary maximum 5.
                    - When there are more than 5 connections, it's a good time to condense these things and organize them in a hierarchy way. So that's making sure there is only 5 [[direct-related connections]] for the [[atomic concept]].
            - What is not okay?
                - Too many direct connections
                - Try to link to different context - should be focus on 1 thing only
- Components
    - [[external knowledge]] for effective learning
