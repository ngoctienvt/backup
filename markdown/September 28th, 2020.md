- Last night I dreamed about finding relationship and sexual. I still haven’t fully transform this. And I still use some tactics to try to achieve my [[personal needs]] instead of let things as they are.
- I felt so much [[anger]] inside myself because I feel that others want to control me. [[emotions]] [[samskaras]] I don't like the fact that people talk like that's not their problem and talk as if I am the problem. I feel that I want to protect myself, my preferences, my behaviors, my self-concept, and it got hurt when other people blaming it. [[personal needs]] This is a big chance for me to have a leap in my [[spiritual growth]]
    - I noticed that they are not intentional to talk that way and it's just a way they want to make themselves better, but it hit me so much that I nearly got out of control. I can't impersonal anymore and take it personal.
    - I feel hard to resist the urge to pour out the [[anger]] inside of me because I still think it's logical and right. I don't want I am the one who wrong. I am still not able to fully learn the teaching of Michael Singer so that my mind can shift to the realization that they are just things I attach with and they got hit so hard that makes me feel uncomfortable. My job is not to pour them out but merge them in.
    - When the [[anger]] takes place, my awareness is so narrow that I feel hard to zoom out and see things at big picture. 
    - It's the same for the situation that Huyền is not preparing things and make me feel secure that my needs are taking care of properly. I put my responsibility for Huyền and feel uncomfortable when they do not really care about it. [[impersonal responsibilities]]
- I still not sure about [[wisegrow.net]] whether I should extend it for future usage as I'm not really clear if I will focus on it in near future.
- I felt much better after feedback for Hằng about her attitude and the way she expressed her feelings. I felt much more about how to deliver a [[feedback]] in a [[helpful manner]].
    - It will not accuse other for being wrong, but help them to aware their behaviors.
    - It will talk about how I feel and why I want to feedback, so they can have a clear context and not feel that's their fault.
    - It will talk about how they could improve and learn to do things better.
    - It would better if I spend more time to listen and help her facilitate her transformation instead of talking too much.
- Today feedback session makes me help more trust in the [[spiritual journey]] that I took because it would not just right in theory but visible in real time situation as well. And it would not just my growth, but everyone growth.
- I still felt a little [[worry]] about the coaching session with Linh. I still have some attachments here but not sure what it's really is. It's like I'm talking with a person higher than me and will be judge based on my behaviors or performance. [[judgment]]. I will work on this tomorrow. [[September 29th, 2020]]
- I felt so grateful that there is people open and trust me. Life is much easier when we can trust and have compassion for each other.
