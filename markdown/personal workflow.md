    - It needs to be a flow that let me trust the process and as long as I keep doing the process, I will automatically generate good life or good output as a by-product.
    - The goal is not that much important here. It's about the process that always keeps me moving forward on the right track, and never gets lost or gets stuck.
    - The idea is generating better-self everyday, everytime and every moments. As long as I can do this, I will be sure to always have a better life. [[personal end goals]]
    - Some examples of [[personal workflow]] would be
        - Drafting
        - Working
        - Optimizing
    - There should be a general workflow, while there will be detail workflow for smaller activities.
    - Somehow it will be something like this.
        - [[Free-thoughts]] - whatever my thoughts about certain things (questions, emerging thoughts, new ideas...). 
            - How to direct my free-thoughts in a helpful way
                - Clarity what I really want, instead of focus on the method and what's possible first
                - Focus on contextual usages to find true helpful answers
        - Key summary, new awareness, expanded answers - the condensed summarization for the above free-thoughts
        - What's left is what I still need to grow next, or haven't fully clear yet? - [[Expanding questions]]
    - The workflow will develop base on my [[natural progression]] of development and what I'm truly want, then I will develop new way of thinking, learning new things so that it will support the above desire.
        - One of new [[way of thinking]] I feel that I will need to develop now is [[think in a filter way]] instead of the normal searching, or finding way. Think in a filter way is about finding things based on it [[contextual usages]].
        - Other is have a [[workplace]] for what I want to work with like [[Expanding questions]] or where to inbox free thoughts. And then how to put the answers back to their place.
