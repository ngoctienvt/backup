- **Conscious evolution through coaching partnering**
- 
- When we come into life.  
We get drown in the sea of stimuli.
We hear, we see, we feel, we alive.
The world is just too much for us.
We grasp and identify self-concept as a lifesaver
- From that, we distance our true self to the one we think we are
Journey on earth fill with plenty of experiences
Some we like, some we unable to handle yet
We start to cling, to resist, to look out to find who we are
Eventually, we exhaust, collapse and breakdown
- And then a coach come in to offer support
They aid us to detach with our thoughts and feelings
They help us to realize who we truly are, not the one we identified with
The place we are looking for is the place from which we are looking
We realize we have choices and regain our freewill
We notice habit-formed will and guide them to conscious will
Day by day, we die to be reborn
- From there, we grow, evolve, embrace the gift of life
Whether it comes from the form of blessing or hide in the form of misfortune
We find trust in the face of doubt, courage in the face of fear
We find patience in the face of a hard time, gain wisdom in the face of a setback
We find peace in the face of turmoil, gratitude in the face of loss
Love things as they are and honor the nature of things
- A coach is like a flashlight
Illuminate the things we fear, encourage us to live far beyond
Listen for our utmost concern, create the sacred space for vulnerable
Eventually, we return to the source like a drop of water return to the sea
- From a place of surrender, a seat of pure consciousness
We don't know how we get here now.
But weâ€™re already here and will be here for a period of time.
We have the choice to either enjoy the time on earth or to suffer.
We have the choice to live life to the fullest or emptiest.
- For those who lost, found
For those who fear, trust
We all are loved.
Amazing grace.
