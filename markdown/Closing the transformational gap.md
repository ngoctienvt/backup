- [[coaching process]]
- [[end goals]] is the final goal that we want to achieve,
- [[intermediary goals]] are the goals that we need to work with so that it could help us to close [[the transformational gap]], so we can closer to our [[end goals]]
- [[means]] are the [[method]] that helped us to come closer to our goals
- For example: what we aim to will be the [[end goals]], but [[the transformational gap]] is too big that we need to find some [[intermediary goals]] so we can move forward and upgrade ourselves in the process. [[means]] are the methods, practices, supports that helped us in the moving forward process.
- Note: 
    - Most clients can only see their [[intermediary goals]] and focus too much to the [[means]] to achieve it, that most of time makes them get stuck in the process. 
    - The reason is most clients perceived [[intermediary goals]] as [[end goals]], they thought they will get what they really want by achieving it but it's not what usually happens. Most of the time, until and unless their [[hidden concern]] or what's they truly want to reveal and they can see the [[end goals]] that they really want, most of [[coaching]] still work on the surface level. 
    - [[trust]] and [[connection]] are the necessary conditions to establish a healthy coaching relationship that can go deep. Coaches will need to realize that focus too much on the coaching result, they will easy to neglect these conditions. 
    - [[end goals]] of coaches for coaching should be the [[natural progression]] development of clients as a whole through series of free choice, instead of forcing to have short-term results.
