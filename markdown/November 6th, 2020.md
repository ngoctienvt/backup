- I slowly completed my picture. I already somehow developed my [[journey of wisdom]]. It is the process that I will digest external knowledge and self-realization to transform them to my wisdom and share it to the world.
- Now today I will work on what will be my process to achieve my [[personal end goals]] by closing the gap progressively and not feel stuck.
    - The [[bottom-up approach]] is about how I could create [[optimal conditions]] and [[design for emergence]] of wisdom. 
    - While [[top-down approach]] will start mainly with my [[personal end goals]], then break it down to become the things that I just need to clarify and to work on by the support of [[bottom-up approach]].
