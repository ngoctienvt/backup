- Now today I will work on what will be my process to achieve my [[personal end goals]] by closing the gap progressively and not feel stuck.
    - The [[ðŸŒ²Bottom-up Approach]] is about how I could create [[optimal conditions]] and [[design for emergence]] of wisdom. 
    - 
- It seems like my process to achieve my [[personal end goals]] are
    - Identify - What is my end goal
    - Reason - Why I want to achieve this goal
    - Diagnose 
        - Identify "what is" before "what to do"
            - Breakdown the levels
            - Identify the blockages
    - Design the way to achieve the end goal based on the diagnose
    - Execution in reality
    - Review and optimize the whole process with an feedback loop system 
- There will be a different [[stages of development]]
    - Testing / Experimenting
    - Optimizing / Refining
    - Generalizing
- I tend to try to the final step that is generalizing too much, and this makes me include all of the above stages that makes me feel overwhelming, while there is actually different stage to focus on. The reason is I'm not developing the ability to [[breakdown]] things into small things. 

It's like playing puzzle but always try to have the big picture but didn't see that in order to have the big pictures, the fragment need to be on their place first. [[seeing the process]]
- The relationship between a process and a stage of development or end goal is [[the relationship between goal and process]]
    - Process is the way to execute and implement the stage of development.
    - **Process goals**, on the other hand, are all about the process. They are about doing the right thing, regardless of the outcome, knowing that the right activities will lead you to ultimate victory. [[process goal]]
        - Product goals focus on the destination while process goals focus on the journey.
        - Product goals tend to be short-term but process goals tend to be long-term.
        - Product goals are project-oriented while process goals are designed to build habits.
        - Product goals stick to firm deadlines while process goals stick to consistent routines.
        - Product goals define success by the completion of great work.
        - By contrast, **process goals define success as growth in oneâ€™s skills and abilities.**
    - Something related to a very big end goal like a way of living will need to have a process that optimize continuously
        - For example, untether soul is a very big end goal and need to maintain continuously
            - Therefore, a process to move forward this goal continuously is very important.
    - I don't need to care much about the smaller goal though, just need to include it in the bigger end goal and then it will complete naturally.
- I felt that I'm progressing in a good way, and everything just becomes more and more clear on the process. I also start to integrate and develop myself in an exceptional way that I can feel I will learn and master many things when I'm living as a human being on earth. It feels so [[satisfied]] and I just keep letting go anything that makes me can't enjoy the reality.
-  After today yoga activities, I felt that my [[physical body]] starting to become stronger and can handle more in a natural way.
- My main concern when I'm looking for [[Webflow]] is I don't want to spend much time to worry about hosting, maintaining, and dealing with security stuff. I want a system that I can trust and rely on and just work on the important stuff instead. 
    - Some other concern is money. The pricing is now is very high for my usage. I would like to wait until I truly feel that I am ready to commit to show my work to the world consistently and in a natural way. So that I will not drop out like every blog or website that I abandon in the past. [[ðŸŒ±Natural Progression]]
- I start to have some [[blog ideas]] that I want to express myself on. I still not fully sure that it is soul-guidance or the need of personal mind. But I will leave it here first.
    - Writing about myself to practice embracing the vulnerable
    - Writing my understanding from the lecture of higher people like [[Mooji]].
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fPZZ-Nv6Eg&ab_channel=NityaAnanta
    - Writing my understanding about the topic that I learn from higher people to help people embrace that understanding, like Where does the moment in front of us come from?
- I don't have anything need to fear when I write what I saw from the meditation now, because there are all immature thoughts that will be clarify soon. [[inner clarity]]
- I have some thoughts that I want my [[personal blog]] will be able to
    - showing my short-form sharing like facebook status
    - sharing my deep and concise articles about certain things
    - showing a part of my personal life or personal self
- I felt so [[angry]] when I know that people don't seriously do the task that I give them. I felt that my effort is wasted. This is a personal part that I need to let go first. Then I will know what I want to work with them tomorrow.
