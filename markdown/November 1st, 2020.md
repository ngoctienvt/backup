- I felt that some big samskaras that come up and I truly lost with them. At least the good thing is I still remember some big things to relax and release, so that I could come back to my [[seat of consciousness]].
- Yesterday learning and teaching about the [[Session 7 - Learning to let go]] that really help me to understand deeper about the spiritual path.
    - Meditation is mainly to practice [[unattachment centering]] so that I could present and do my work, instead of letting my samskaras and my [[habit-formed will]] control me.
    - [[lower-hanging fruit]] is the samskaras that after we let go, there is nothing left to deal with.
    - [[higher-hanging fruit]] is the samskaras that after we let go, we still need to learn to interact properly with the unfolding moments.
    - For [[living from the place of surrender]], it is 24/7, 
        - the first part is always about [[letting go]]
            - Either samskaras are emerged by themselves, or triggered by the unfolding moments, our job is take time to relax and release. This is about handling the accumulated stuff. [[mature samskaras]]
            - Second is not putting more stuff everyday, because one small samskara can be a source to accumulate many other samskara. [[immature samskaras]]
        - the second part is learning to [[serving the demand of reality]]
    - The most important thing is not about [[understanding the truth]], it is about the [[desire]] to live the truth itself. Without the willingness, everything is just like water off a duck's back. And the soul will asleep in the sea of samskaras. [[desire to live the higher life]]
- I also noticed that I have a big expectation for people to truly awake and truly consider what they want to do with their life. Even though this expectation is good, but it's not really what I want. Because I don't want to put my pressure or expectation into other people, instead of that, I just want to support and empower them, so that they could awake and make their own choice. [[tough love]] [[unattachment empowering]] 
- This week my major samskaras related to my need for protecting what's important to me. [[need for protection]] It's a big thing that related to my Tiáº¿n's principle sub-personality that it based on what I trust on what's the right thing. And I need to let go these needs and embrace the what's truly the right thing. [[seeing the truth of the world]]
