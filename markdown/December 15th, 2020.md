- Today I noticed that I still have many samskaras going inside of me when I'm teaching or supporting other people. I still have many attachments and expectations about how thing should happen. This is a big time for me to learn to let go all of these [[samskaras]], so that I can take my responsibilities for my ability to teach and support other people, instead of blaming them, or try to control them to suite my needs.
