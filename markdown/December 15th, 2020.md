- Today I noticed that I still have many samskaras going inside of me when I'm teaching or supporting other people. I still have many attachments and expectations about how thing should happen. This is a big time for me to learn to let go all of these [[samskaras]], so that I can take my responsibilities for my ability to teach and support other people, instead of blaming them, or try to control them to suite my needs.
- There will be general of what's truly matter that is about the person and the moment, not what I think or what pre-schedule [[ðŸŒ±focus on what matters]]. My job is to clear about what's truly matter and always right to focus on, it's always higher and need to take care most in all of situation.
    - Some of my thoughts now are emergence, deep listening, expression instead of direction, holding space, trust the process, let things unfold, dig deeper, connection, trust, openness,...
    - Less talk, more listen. Less lead, more connect.
    - At least let go all of what I think is right and should be is one of the most important step, because what important is not what's inside me, but what unfolding.
- My journey of become a master trainer and a master coach is still a long journey, but my preparation for how to reach the end is pretty clear when I'm able to deal with my internal things, so that's it will not mess up my journey.
