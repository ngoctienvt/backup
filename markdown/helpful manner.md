- helpful manner is a manner that focuses on raising the moments or the person in front of me in an [[efficient]] way instead of using them to satisfy my [[personal needs]] or releasing my unhandled samskaras.
- There are two parts of a helpful manner
    - One is I need to evolve myself enough to not let the samskaras controlled me [[soul evolution]]
        - [[ðŸŒ±Unshakable Centering]] to hold myself above any samskaras so that I will not react but release instead
    - Second is after this evolve and learning process, I will handle the situation with a [[support attitude]]
        - [[generative language]] to shift the tendency to resist and cling to learn in a much enjoyable, meaningful way
        - [[unattachment]] with any personal agenda, personal needs and only work to unconditionally serve the reality
