- [[journaling training]] The way we note needs to operate in a way that allows for bottom-up as well as top-down thinking with an easy way to edit and adapt along with the go.

This need to let each idea in an atomic level so that it could contain smaller thoughts. When the multiple ideas are not mature yet, they can hold on to the same level before I decide that I could split them.

- I felt pretty cold on the morning and would like to know how I could my body in warm. One is conscious awareness, second is external supports from clothes,... [[physical body]]
- [[Morning Rituals MOC]] I felt that I want to have an activity that is a dynamic of force which start moving and [[snowball]] me. I will start this with 6 A.M tomorrow. My only concern is I also worry about the sleep. If I slept late, it would be hard for me to wake up at 6 A.M because the inner stress pull me down too strong and it requires a strong will-power to break down this habit-formed will.
    - There are 2 ways that I need to handle with this
    - I need to ensure that I stop all activities and able to sleep at around 11 PM. [[bedtime rituals]]
        - For this, I want to make sure that I complete everything and stop at 10:40, and could read about around 20 minute, then just fall asleep.
        - I need to overcome my addiction for gaming, youtube, and facebook. So I want to meditation and 10 PM, and reading book at 10:20 PM, and writing at 10:40.
        - Roughly these times so I can have a good bedtime rituals to end my day.
    - I need to practice to build up will-power to break free old habit-formed will and the first few days is not easy but I could do if my intention is strong enough.
        - So now I actually need to build my intention here. The reason I want to have a [[Morning Rituals MOC]] is to start moving my desire which is [[living from the place of surrender]].
        - It's a starting point of the [[snowball]] for me to roll things out. As long as I kept getting this starting point, I can move further along the line.
    - It feel much better now, though in the beginning it's totally ok to somehow miss the details, but the 2 most important points are 11PM and 6AM will need to be ensure.
- Today focus:
    - {{[[DONE]]}} lesson about true independent and true personal [[impersonal responsibilities]]
        - I have a little bit thoughts about this when reading novels that I still need to have a [[truth compass]] for me to making decision. This compass absolutely will not about my [[personal needs]] but rather it will build based on [[truth]] and it will require me to stretch my self to [[meeting the demand of reality]]. 

I don't want to force myself to meet that demand, but rather I will develop a natural process coming from [[soul evolution]] happens first, then realizing the truth and developing the courage to act based on that [[truth]]. This is really the starting point for the [[impersonal responsibilities]] that I want to hold for myself in this life.
- I tend to stop working when my spine feel tired, I want to rest and will comeback to work again later after around 30'. [[energy management]]
- In this afternoon meditation, I could feel that my desire for [[living from the place of surrender]] need to have the first part is find out what is the most natural and right process for living this life?
    - I realized that it's about freeing myself completely out of all the [[personal needs]] [[samskaras]] that I hold inside created thoughts to make me distract out of my [[cleaning and integrating process]]. 
    - The process for [[living from the place of surrender]] [[truth compass]]
        - First, cleaning all of the inner [[samskaras]]. Then I will not have any personal thoughts, personal needs but replacing them with the fuel of inner energy, the evolution of soul, increasing capacity to handle things. It means that raising my soul equal to the [[demand of reality]]. 

[[meeting the demand of reality]] through the process of [[soul evolution]]
        - Second, after able to raise my soul equal to the demand of reality. It will not a challenge, a personal achievement, a recognition for myself anymore, because there is no such things as [[personal needs]] left here. There is only the soul that transcended fuel with the inner upward energy.

Due to that energy, I can start to express them outside in an impersonal way to [[serving the demand of reality]] to [[living from the place of surrender]].

[[serving the demand of reality]] requires me to interact with the physical in many ways. It could be about writing, sharing, talking, doing, impacting, influencing, thinking,... All of the activities that the soul involves with the [[impersonal reality]].
        - The important keywords here are [[impersonal responsibilities]] and [[natural progression]]. That's it. As I master these two things, I could carry myself to handle anything that life bring to me in the most [[helpful manner]].
- I also felt that I developed a desire for toughing with myself and with the person who want to follow or work with me as well. I still felt that this desire still have the part that personal which is about my ideas about how others should  be, but it also have an impersonal part which is together we [[serving the demand of reality]] by our [[impersonal responsibilities]]. 

Because if I'm not have a [[tough love]] and [[high standards]], I will feel hard to develop a [[surrender teams]] that could shoulder to each other, I still feel that I'm like carrying and teaching them instead of shoulder to shoulder for each other. [[teammates]]
- I realized that in order to [[living from the place of surrender]], I could use [[impersonal language]] based on [[truth compass]] to start shift my [[intellectual mind]] to think in that way. 

It's like creating a gap between my perception based on samskaras and the truth, so that I am easy to notice when I start to identify with my samskaras so I could come back to the seat of awareness and let go easier. [[dis-identification]] [[establishing the seat of awareness]]
- I still have some parts inside of me have problems with [[fairness]], [[identification]] to the human parts that makes me judge other people and have a hard time to fully accept that no one is wrong and bad, these are only a stimulation place for us to support our [[soul evolution]] process.

I want to transcend myself over this as this will be a big shift inside of me that let go all of the anger, disturbance, identification about the concept of [[fairness]], good or bad, right or wrong, acceptance or judgment. 

When I manage to learn this lesson, I will be able to merge all of the perception to the truth and experience the truth itself. [[life lessons]]
- After today yoga practices, I feel I start to connect more with my body and I also learn to relax on the process as well. [[being while doing]]
- 
    - relax when no disturbance
    - relax when there is disturbance
    - relax when doing
    - relax when there is disturbance and doing
- When I'm playing Spirit Island, I learned that it would very helpful to [[setting up for success]] as learning the game slowly which help to digest the experiences and grow our understanding as well as skills in a [[progressive development approach. 

The way to do this is break things down and focus on 1 things at a time. For instance
    - Learning about the ability of spirit
    - Learning about the actions of invaders
    - Learning about the winning conditions
    - Learning about the combination between power cards and innate powers
    - Learning about the innate powers...
    - By setting up for success like reduce the difficult and focus on 1 to 2 concepts at a time, it's help to understand each things deeply and makes the learning experiences are not overwhelming and requires too much stretching, but put a fun factor and a deep sense of satisfy by able to evolve thanks to digest the experiences instead.

    - [[psychology]] [[mere-exposure effect]] doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it [[productivity]]
    - 
    - The differences between teachers and experts are teachers good at theory, but experts good at handling situation. The teachers follow structure, while the experts flow in the scenario. [[mastery]] 
    - Remembering are different with understanding. Things we understand are connected and have meaningful connections. [[deeper understanding]]
    - [[Zeigarnik effect]] Open tasks occupy our short-term memory - until they are done. Tips: We don't have to finish, but rather write them down so trick our brains to stop thinking about them.
    - [[Conditions for flow]] 1. Break down tasks so they can finish in 1 go.2. Write down outcomes, including possible connections.
    - The [[externalization]] of writing helps us to keep our work outside, and comeback whenever we want so our mind no need to keep them in mind like RAM. [[mind-training]] [[productivity]] [[writing]]

This really helps to pick up the task where we at without the need to keep in our mind is a really way to use our [[intellectual mind]] in a effective way.

- On Saturday, I want to share about freedom and wisdom, because this is really two things that makes me have a true happiness and a way of living. [[true happiness]] [[natural progression]]
- For the [[truth compass]], I think that my main way to make decision on life is not about truth. Actually truth is what I can see and know what are really happening, but my decision is different. 

It will be about what I feel right at the moment depending on my inner state at that time, so it will not fixed on truth, but rather fluid on situation but still based on the truth that I saw. [[decision-making]] 

The decision-making will be based on the whole thing available at that moment. [[wholeness]] 
- I will need to more clear about when I'm on and off my thinking activities as well, if not I will always a state of doing rather than completely being and come back to myself or fully enjoy the moment. [[time management]] [[productivity]]
