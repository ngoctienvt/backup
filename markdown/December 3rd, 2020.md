- Last night dream, I had so much fear and limit myself under the rules of society. I noticed that's I also had a tendency to try to gain benefits for myself, instead of thinking in a way that's not for my personal self, but for reality. [[samskaras]]
- My today focus will be about 
    - concrete thinking
    - letting go
    - take note the 3rd video
- It feels much more central when I'm keep reminding myself that's I'm living inside a human body that's living on a vast universe. [[Who am I]] [[unattachment centering]]
    - This release me to the tiny stuff that I keep inside myself and nurture my courage and openness to the universe.
    - My personal self is so small comparing to what's possible in this universe.
