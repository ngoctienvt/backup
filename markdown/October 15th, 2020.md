- I felt a little cold this morning. My physical body is sensitive with the environment and not able to handle a tough environment yet. [[physical body]]
- I noticed that the experience that other people have with me is statically insignificant compared with the billions of moments that happen everywhere and the moments that happen for them when there is no me in there. This awareness helps me to release the [[personal needs]] for taking too many unnecessary responsibilities in myself.

My job is doing the best as I could, but not responsible for their life. They will be the ones who responsible for their life. [[unattachment supporting]]
- When we are able to relax and fully lean back to the [[seat of consciousness]]. We could have a [[panorama view]] to see life in much broader and higher point of view. This [[panorama view]] plus [[helicopter view]] are the core skills that any coach need to develop. [[coaching]]

This helps us to see life in a much broader picture so that what we need to resolve clearly emerge on that space.  [[design for emergence]]
- I felt that I'm learning to shift fully from [[linear thinking]] to [[network thinking]] which release the roles of categories and embrace the roles of connections.
- I'm on a stage that building the foundations for everything I will develop based on this [[basic foundation]].
- [[coaching reflection]] I noticed that when coaching, I'm going a counter-intuitive approach. I put my way of coaching mainly on [[top-down boundary]] instead of [[bottom-up evolution]], and let the [[top-down boundary]] as a supplement instead.

This makes my coaching become pre-mature and not feel natural, though it's helpful. It's just the process is not really what [[deep coaching]] really means.
- When I want to ask to know about [[Nguyễn Mỹ Linh]] situation. I felt that my way of asking is too general which often leads the other person to find hard to answer. I want it to at least a little bit specific so that people could easier look back on their situation. 

Instead of [[vague questions]], it's about [[contextual questions]]. Not leading, just context. The question with clear context also show how much I understand and connect with that person's situation. 
- When going to buy an audio theater, I want to let myself focus on what's really necessary instead of letting my [[personal needs]] drive the way. I will focus on the fact that I want to have a simple audio system that [[audio theater]]
    - support me to listen music externally in a relaxing way
    - the volume is low but clear
    - the price is low and good enough for easy to replace without concern too much
    - the features are simple and focus on PC usage.
    - I also want to learn more about how PC connect with the audio theater, how the process works, and what's the difference? 
- I noticed that I spent too much time for unnecessary [[worry]] instead of spending time to clear the fog and make [[conscious choice]] so that I could live it there and don't need to care about it any more. [[inconvenient of life flow]]
-  I felt my expectations and standards and the fear of not meeting my expectations making me feel uncomfortable and numbing. [[expectations]]
- Start from the top is mostly about expectations and clinging. Instead of that, I want to always stay at the bottom and climb the mountain up slowly with the [[openness]] and [[abundance appreciation]] attitude [[bottom-up evolution]] 
    - When I start with [[top-down boundary]], I notice that I'm working with theory too much.
    - When I start with [[bottom-up evolution]], I will start with a relaxing and gradual attitude to learn and not accumulate stress, because I start without any pressure.
- I still have a tendency to teach others suddenly, it could be helpful but without full awareness, there is still a lot of [[redundant information]] that I talk in a natural way. [[intentional]]
