- There is a nightmare that I lost few of my teeth. The fear, anxiety, worry is so strong that I just want to escape that situation. But I practiced remain [[unattachment centering]] this morning to accept even if that's situation happen. Actually it's just accept the movie that my mind created based on the stored samskaras, so first, it's not what happened yet, and even if it's happened, I have no other choice to accept and deal with it. So resistance is unneccessary, embrace is.
- The ability to embrace the [[dark side]] is very important for me. It's half of reality that makes me become stronger, mature, develop true strength, true courage. While the [[light side]] is about developing the compassionate, love, trust,... [[unattachment centering]]
- Today focus:
    - Editing video 8
    - Learning Productivity
    - Building my workflow
- It's a rest day for me since I noticed that my [[physical body]] is hot, not work as intended, it's my responsibility for taking proper rest for it through meditation.
- I also start to able to maintain myself to do high-quality activities like learning and note-taking, processing what I learned, I'm starting to have a right intentional direction that will serve a productive life. [[meaningful life]]
- I'm quite good on the unifying stage, and it seems like a little bit ready to come to the next step, the step of writing and nurturing [[Evergreen notes]]. I will try to [[form-shaping]] the PKDS first, then I will optimize it later.
- There are still feeling [[worry]] about the future, about what will happen, what could happen that I'm not able to resolve yet. Anyway, it's a good day on earth, I will take rest and have a good sleep tonight. 
- I noticed that I start to develop the habit to consume quality information that related to my main works like coaching or spiritual. [[habit]]
- At night, it's good for me to develop a [[keystone habit]] that consume quality content instead of forcing myself to sleep or drowning in the social media.
