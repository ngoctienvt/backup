- [[Progressive Development Approach]]
    - an approach for natural and effortless personal and professional development
- ## Benefits
    - self-expression /self-uniqueness
    - [[natural progression]]
        - stress-free
        - sustainable development
    - structured and deep understanding
    - learing to enjoy the process instead of skip through to the goals
- ## Core methods
    -  [[Bottom-up Approach MOC]] for merging with the experiences
        - [[integration]]
    -  [[Top-down Approach MOC]] for focusing myself to certain direction
        - [[Evergreen notes]]
- ## Core principles
    - living life as a [[circular process]]
        - focused on [[enjoy the process]] or journey instead of a [[linear process]] focused on [[results]]
        - flow to integration instead of separation
        - see life as continuous process instead of separation stages only [[continuous process]]
    - build up the emerge structure and solidify them over time 
        - [[design for emergence]]
            - [[Bottom-up Approach MOC]] to create [[optimal conditions]] for the emergence of new insights, ideas, solutions, creations in a natural way 
        - building [[basic foundation]]
        - flexibility with [[contextual mastery]] and different direction of development (convergence/divergence)
    - ensure the focus on what's truly effective
        - right person
            - [[establishing the seat of awareness]]
        - right focus
            - breakdown process for easier digesting and productive batching
            - [[focus mode]] + [[diffuse mode]] = [[being mode]]
            - focus on true progression instead of the feeling of doing something meaningful, like instead of focusing on bolding and highlighting/ focus on self-commentary instead.
                - [[getting in touch with reality]] to [[work at the root]]
        - right reflection
            - looping with [[built-in feedback loop]]
        - right tools
            - [[support system]] to utilize external tools, so internal tools focus energy on what's important 
                - creating an [[Evergreen garden]] to support thoughts process and store personal knowledge [[workspace for intellectual mind]]
                - [[coaching]]
        - momentum
            - [[setting up for success]] to create [[snowball]]
                - [[positive inner feedback loop]]
- ### Core components:
- ## Supportive components:
- ### What I want to apply this approach
    - way of living
    - personal knowledge development
    - working/ creating products
- In your Dynamic Note Mass, what does that look like?
    - Sometimes __bottoms-up__ creates meaning: Note » MOC » Index
    - Sometimes __top-down__ creates meaning: Index » MOC » Note
    - Sometimes __middle-out__ creates meaning: MOC » Note, and MOC » Index
- The [[starting point]] of everything is established a solidify [[basic foundation]] so that I can come back at any time. The role of a basic foundation is to establish a [[Top-down Approach MOC]], a broad viewpoint that includes things I want to work on. It would help to set me a [[truth compass]] to come back when I feel lost or to expand myself based on the experience that I gained. [[life flow]] [[progressive approach]]
    - The reason to have a [[starting point]] is to realize that things have different levels or different progress to work on. [[Top-down Approach MOC]] The starting point is established by 
        - learning and getting used to what's possible, 
        - what's the floor and what's the possible ceiling?
        - what's the meaning of this?
    - After establishing a starting point, the next thing is about the [[mastery]] process. The process of mastery is what's I actually do in the [[Top-down Approach MOC]] that I defined. 
        - It's about listing the things that I want to master. The things to master will have different levels as well. 
            - One is to understand the components.
            - Second is to have a synthesis or a goal to use things together. [[synthesis]]
        - Choose and go deep to acquire a [[deeper understanding]] in each thing [[bottom-up approach
        - Synthesis things by a [[Top-down Approach MOC]] that have goals, challenges, application oriented as a result.
        - Reflection after each learning to condense knowledges and experiences. [[condensing and generative process]]
    - The third step is going beyond.
        - Come back to the foundation and start to [[bottom-up approach things.
- I also start to realize the bottom of the floor and the top of the ceiling, so that I could put the clear boundaries or definitions for them, then I can start to work the middle in detail. [[progressive approach]]
    - The [[top of the ceiling]] is about all 4 broad elements of the world, the nature of each of them, and the relationship of them.
    - The [[bottom of the floor]] is about the actual experience of each moment and the interaction of each moment with the 4 elements.
    - The middle is the human life that happens in the world based on the tools that the conscious have: emotions, mind, body.
