- I noticed that the relationship between me and my mind is not good now. I can't handle it properly yet, basically I felt quite annoy and not able to just let it talk but able to simply ignore it. I still easily distracted and drawn into it. This is the big thing that I will need to learn work with.
    - This stage of life I will not depend on my mind to do everything but rather learn how to use it properly, and use external things to help me process. My mind only need to involve as a part of a bigger system, rather than using it to cover every part of my life now. [[presence]] is not just about being presence, it's about working with the inner system - beliefs, habits, hidden agendas,.. so that's I can presence in the right way.
        - [[Kolb's experiential learning model]] is a good way for me to think about and start with.
            - There will be stage that I'm focusing on doing and experencing only, stage that I will look watch and see what happens, then there will be a stage I will use my mind to think.
            - This will free myself more of the addiction to use my mind only, and also help to increase my productivity as well as my well-being. 
        - My mind also need to streamline to a path of clear output-oriented or have a clear intention to direct it. Without this, I will easily feel loss or just do the habit things and less things gradually build up, but it's not the satisfied way to live life. It's living under capacities.
- In tonight session, I will allow myself to be relax and focus on the experience, rather than worry about how things will happen. I will let myself fully see the session tonight as an learning experience where I and my groupmates learn to do better. It's about taking the experiences to become the better me, rather than trying to do things perfectly. 
    - This new way of seeing life will release my cognitive burden and live life as an journey much better.
    - I will do my best, but will let go of any expectations for what should happen. And appreciate all of the experiences that will happen, whether how it's turn out. As life is not about the end result, it's all about the journey and the experiences.
- I also noticed that my mind is easily stimulate and follow the track of other people information as that should the way we think, without carefully stop, pause and think clearly first, because what other people stated is not based on truth or probably not where we should start with. [[habit-formed will]] [[seeing problems as opportunities for exploration first]]
    - Mostly it will base on their beliefs, their perceptions, their way of seeing the world... if we take it as a truth and follow the path, we will be limit and maybe stuck together with them. 
    - Sometimes I feel restless as feeling the pressure to be able to see things fast, but gradually I notice that it's rather to pause and reflect, even it took more time but it's far more better than getting loss by trying to do too much.
- I noticed that my mind tend to repeat the scenario many times as it is not secure for how things will happen. I felt quite worry and anxious about this, but I'm learning to accept that everything is just situations and experiences for me to grow. It's not about proving myself, it's about how I can grow and how can support others people by doing my best abilities at the moment.
- I'm learning so much from today experiences.
    - Learn about myself
        - I still seems to easy to have split agendas and this is what makes me do not truly effective and not fully serve the moment in their best way - now I still tend to help them in how I think what's best.
            - One of the reason is I am feel lazy to do more, I'm rather to have many experiences at once, and take time to digest them later. It's mean that my learning loop is not short, but quite a long loop. [[self-learning]] [[learning loop]]
                - It would be better if I could shorten the learning loop, so that I can handle things much more effectively, and in a much more relax manner.
            - I have the fear that I won't serve other best based on my abilities, but I have a wrong thinking. Because what best for them will not based on my thoughts, but based on reality.
        - Evaluate myself too much and not see the meaning of other people existence
        - Anyway, the good thing is I have a pretty strong thinking abilities and cognitive load. This is one of the most strengths of myself. However, it will need to get support from other abilities as well.
    - Learn about an interesting models to help people [[self-learning]]. I will resolve more information about this later.
    - Learn about [[ðŸŒ±Instructional Design]]
        - The content created from students should be resolve by them, not me.
        - Acting more as a facilitator rather than an expert
- [[Daily Worthy Stories]] Instructional Design. Activitiy. Split agendas. Competent to expert. Feel hard to slow.
