- I'm not so sure why but when coaching with [[@Uông Duy Khánh]]. He has ability that could help me clarity my thoughts and identify what I want so easy. I feel that his questions bring me to a higher point of view directly with concise. It focuses on what need to be clear and clarify the rest in a smooth way. 

    - While I still sometimes stuck on the problem of the clients and not able to help them focus on themselves yet, and my coaching is not helping them to identify the room for change or what they want in a broad way yet. It's still rather limiting and not connected with a big picture. [[room for desire]] [[zoom-out point of view]]
