- When reading novels, I realize that I also have many
limitations on my belief system. [[limiting thoughts]]
- Untitled_2 [[Courses - Living from the place of surrender]]
- Today I want to keep myself with [[bottom-up approach, I
fully experience the moments and then I will know what I need to do next. I
will stop [[living in the future]] or at least know that I need to come back to
now, because everything is already here that I need to understand and fully
experience them first.  [[current working]]
- I felt so much fun when teaching and also [[deeper understanding]] for myself from today spiritual lessons. It's very satisfying
when seeing people learning the [[hard-truth]]. Because this pain is what
really needs to confront and will give true solutions for true happiness.
- [[concise]] is about clear intention, enough and trust the
process.
- Today coaching with [[@Nguyễn Mỹ Linh]], I would like to have
a far step-back to let her tell more and I will listen more to really
understand and establish a deep connection with her first. I will also let go
of any top-down agendas so that I can fully meet her at where she was and help
her from that position instead.
- It's about [[meet people
where they are]] instead of where I think they should be.
- I also want my language
will be more [[concise]] instead of explaining or talking too much.
- I realize that when what I like to attach with a comeback to
me, I start to try to grab and cling to it as best as possible. Instead of just
let things be and raise it up naturally without any attachments. [[living from the place of surrender]] [[unattachment]]
- Planning for next next week:
    - 
- [[spiritual practices]] The hard part of spirituality is not
about the practices or time, but about the choice of handle or resist, of
release or cling.
- I felt so much tired and want to less do sexual things due
to the exhaustion of [[physical energy]].
- [[being mode]] is the mode that emphasizes on centering on
the seat of awareness and [[relaxing]] to let go any resistance or
attachments.
- [[Morning Rituals MOC]] It would be easier to meditation first,
then do personal activities later.
- My thoughts about [[natural progression]] now focus
on how to integrate everything that is not yet handled, so I could fully
present at now first. [[living in the future]] or [[living in the past]] is
just the result of clinging and resisting that keep the [[samskaras]] stuck
inside.
- So there is two kinds of now or present moment [[now]]
    - One is the now that I focus on the moment in front of me and the current relationship of me and that moment
    - The second is to focus on my inner thoughts, emotions, and sensations that are distracting me from the moment in front of me.
    - [[living in the present]] is not about choosing the first or second now but about union the second now with me, so that I could fully present with the first now that are always unfolding and changing.
- [[integration]] [[transformation]] What I need to integrate and develop new way of living are:
    - [[habit-formed will]]
    - [[emotions]]
    - thoughts - [[union thoughts]]
    - languages - [[generating languages]]
    - behaviors - [[helpful manner]]
    - way of thinking
- [[deep coaching]] In deep coaching, it's important to notice the intersection that makes clients going out instead of work on themselves. It's the part that they can't handle inside so they use outside to serve as a solution. [[reflection]]
    - For instance, if a client want to have a higher salary, it's because there is a part inside of them that want to have a higher salary so that it will not feel uncomfortable or stuck inside.
    - Pointing to the right part is very important because it will [[evoke awareness]] that directly relate to what client need to deal with.
- [[living in the present]] I have a sensation about building up this thing is like I connect with all of the earth that below me (past experiences, my accumulated self, my past journey...) that are integrated and easy to relate with. Then I will just continue to build up myself from that based on [[demand of reality]] instead of worrying about where I need to go to. [[bottom-up approach [[being mode]] 
- And if I want to connect with others deeply, I also need to just not see what's above the earth but understand what below it. [[deep connection]] Without true understanding, it's very easy for my mind to make its own interpretation and make me trust those very low possibilities to true interpretations.
    - [[the accumulated self]]
    - [[demand of reality]]
    - ### willpower to direct myself to [[meeting the demand of reality]]
- [[self-fulfilled]] is the highest intention that I want to
meet my [[inner demand of reality]]. I don't want to let any external things
responsible for my inner container. I still feel grateful, enjoy, honor, but
not put the responsibility on them. [[personal responsibilities]]
- When bathing, I noticed that how I look at and name things is different depends on the view [[horizons of focus]] [[rules for naming]] [[generating languages]]
    - results - be clean inside
    - process or actions - integration
    - meaning - evolution
- I felt kind of uncomfortable when playing with drift joy-con because it feels [[inconvenient]] and not meet the minimum standards that are not faulty. [[personal standards]]
- It seems like for buying necessary things. Half of the price that I feel comfortable to pay is a good way to make choice. [[the middle way]]
- There is an intersection between [[self-learning]] and learning from the [[external knowledge]] is that it focuses on solving the current [[demand of reality]]  which is the current context. [[contextual mastery]]
    - [[self-learning]] come to context with a [[bottom-up approach attitude.
    - [[external knowledge]] help to optimize the situation from a [[top-down approach
- [[From separation to union life]] [[integration]] [[natural progression]]
    - The societies split life into many different aspects
        - Work, life, social, entertainment, spiritual...
        - Physics, Math, Biology,...
        - father, son, colleague, friend, trainer, coach...
    - There is only one life, there is no hard-boundary in life. The splitting is the result of human mind and our job is not to believe that how it works. The truth is life are one.
    - All of the words that based on [[separation]] mindset is work-life balance, coach, trainer, father, mother, son, boyfriend, girl friend, roles,...
