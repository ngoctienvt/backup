- It's been two long days for me to not release my inner thoughts. I noticed that I'm not able to love my parents unconditionally, there are many samskaras that I still haven't able to resolve yet. [[unconditional relationship]]
- This morning, I have such an inspiration to learn more deeply from great beings or thinkers like [[Michael Singer]] or [[Yuval Noah Harari]]. [[great beings]]

And I also want to great an impact for our world by expressing my wisdom that coming from my own true self, my own experiences and my own learnings. Depending on the level that I want to write, there will be different things that I need to self-experience and learn from.
    - Michael Singer taught me to see the truth from a super high level of perspectives, from a person who has gone through the pinnacle of spiritual path. [[level of thinking]]
    - [[Yuval Noah Harari]] has been a great thinker that gone through deep research and think critically. By learning from these great thinkers, this is a much easier approach for people who still not identify or aware of themselves as [[consciousness]].
- I noticed that my ability to [[centering on the seat of awareness]] is still weak and not solidify yet. I'm still easy to be disturbed by small things that happen around me.
- There are few things that determine how deep I live this life are [[E: How deep I live my life?]] [[The Pilot MOC]]
    - One is about cleaning the inner blockages and explore my true self
    - Second is about how deep I learn about the world - from my own experiences, intellectual mind, and learn from other [[great beings]].
    - I think that I would focus to solidify the lower-stage that I has been through, especially the current stage.
        - And learn to support and raise myself to reach the next stage.
- "What is the desired outcome?" and "What is the Next Action." This is two great questions to start my thinking about how to name projects and task [[Horizons of Focus Management MOC]] [[Tag usage]]
    - For projects, I created a rich-text layout in the Notes field that allows me to document as much or as little about the project as I want.
    - **SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME**
        - What will have happened when you can mark this completed?
    - **MASTER PROJECT**
        - If this is a sub-project, enter the master project name here.
        - (Also, you can create a link to the object in outlook)
    - **BACKGROUND**
        - Note any background information that will be helpful in reminding you of the project's purpose.
    - **DEPENDENCIES**
        - List all dependencies that affect this project including other projects, people, weather, etc.
    - **RESPONSIBLE**
        - If you have delegated the project to another person or group, list it here.
    - **FUTURE ACTIONS / SUB-PROJECTS**
        - Note any future actions or sub-projects that you may need to track but are not yet ready to add to lists.
    - **COMMENTS / IDEAS**
        - Add comments and random ideas about the project here.
    - **HISTORY**
    - Underneath the **SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME** heading, I describe in past tense what will have happened when the project is completed. Sometimes I merely rewrite the subject line rewritten in past tense, but other times I may make a list of multiple outcomes.
    - To use a previous example, if I wanted to conquer Albania (I love the examples, by the way), I would create a project "task" that looks like this:
        - **Subject**: Conquer Albania
        - **Notes**:
        - **SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME**
            - Albania invaded
            - Albanian government overthrown
            - Inhabitants sujugated and ground under iron heel
            - Victory lunch eaten
        - **MASTER PROJECT**
        - Conquer the world!!!
        - **FUTURE ACTIONS / SUB-PROJECTS**
            - Organize a private army
            - Kidnap and execute the head of the Albanian government
        - **COMMENTS / IDEAS**
            - Salmon and snow peas for victory lunch?
        - **HISTORY**
- I start to able to develop myself to think more clearly by differentiating the difference between tasks and projects. Each thing will require a way of looking that suitable for it, so that's it becomes clear.  [[Horizons of Focus Management MOC]]
- I noticed that I still feel uncomfortable when hearing other people judge, put their own expectation as truth, ignore or suppress other people feelings, or manipulate other people behaviours, even unconsciously. [[samskaras]]
