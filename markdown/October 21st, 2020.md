- â€¢	Last night [[dream]], I noticed my tendency to satisfy my [[sexual desire]] by external solutions, but avoid taking [[personal responsibilities]] with that solutions.
- â€¢	I also realized that I want to learn to let myself integrate every single samskaras that popup without the [[need for understanding]] them. I could learn to resolve them after that. [[trust the process]] [[embrace the unknown]] [[life lessons]]
- Today focus:
    - handling fear, sexual desire, releasing attachments
    - handling habit-formed will to check facebook [[staying in
the moment]]
    - editing video 6
- [[personal responsibilities]]
    - I could handle my [[sexual desire]] by metaphor my body just
as my bike, I would not pour its problem to other people unconsciously.
Instead, I will learn to handle it by myself first, and only ask for support
when really needed. I respect other people's body as they have no
responsibility for my inner problems and honour their existence for their own's
sake. [[honoring]] [[dis-identification]]
    - I also need to learn that whether I'm conscious or
unconscious doing my actions, I need to learn to fully take responsibilities
for the unconscious parts as they are the result of my inability to handle my
own [[samskaras]] or my own [[inner urge]]. [[reaction]]
- [[knowledge development process]]
    - The way I keep track my personal knowledge through its development process is not fully clear at the moment. [[preparing resources]]
        - for collecting raw materials, I feel that it's very important to keep it in a way that I can easily come back to what I haven't resolved yet. My current method is using Resources to keep track of things. But I have the worry when it will become clustering when there are more things. [[clustering]]
        - raw materials would not a perfect name to mention the collection of unresolved input from reading, experience, failing,... [[raw data]] is a better name to relate with.
    - Other is what if there is some knowledge that case-sensitive and I need to do them in a hard-boundary situation instead of merging them to my whole life. [[personal knowledge development]]
        - I want to able to integrate them and also split them at the same time in a natural way. [[ðŸŒ±Natural Progression]]
        - 2 components: situational interaction and general interaction
            - general is about my daily life
        - while case-sensitive is about some situation that I need to operate in a specific way to complete a certain case-sensitive intention like coaching, training,...
        - so basically general is mainly only me interact with myself or just simply flow to enjoy the experiences [[enjoy the learning experience]]
        - enjoy the learning experience is not truly complete my way of thinking. Because I feel that I still not clear about simply experience and digest the meaning or handle the hard experiences. It kinds of two different process.
        - while case-sensitive is about the interaction between me and the contextual situation of reality, so it's about the second step is [[meeting the demand of reality]] or [[interacting with life]]
- [[problem-solving process]] [[design for emergence]]
    - write down thoughts and feelings
    - break down the components
    - write to deeper understanding about each component and also
clear the confusion, overlapping between them.
    - the solution emerge as a result from [[optimal conditions]]
- the shift from [[exclusion]] to [[inclusion]] attitude is very important because only by inclusion, the thing can become [[wholer]] and simpler at the same time. [[integration]].
- I realized that [[spiritual growth]] is not just the fact that the soul evolve by merging with experiences, it's also about the soul able to consciously direct it to [[higher intention]].
    - For example, when I realize that I don't want to addict to my mind, I wonder then what I want to do instead of that. It requires me to learn to have my own intention to do what instead.
- I still not have a clear [[thought process]] for condensing
thoughts that makes me feel clustering and confusing. I will work more on this.
[[compressed process]]
- I have a [[fear of troubles]] that make me hard to
compassion and caring for other people in an [[helpful manner]].
- I have a [[judgment]] for people who are mostly cared for
themselves only and have thought make me believe that they don't even care
about other people without really checking this first. [[perception]]
- [[thought process]] [[truth compass]] [[coaching language]] want is an easy to misunderstand word. It's a word that can be soul-guidance or ego-guidance. I want to have a word that making more hard boundary to imply soul-guidance. [[generated language]]
    - So actually it's not really about the word, it's about what state the soul in when receiving the question. [[state of being]] If the state is identified with samskaras, emotions, thoughts, then the answer will reveal these identified objects rather what the soul will want when it's free.
- [[tough love]] I want to develop a [[mature]] tough love that fully impersonal and not be attach with any method, solution, desire, but rather base on [[compassion]].
- What I want when finding a centralized messenger system is
    - â€¢	contextual approach for different usage instead of many groups of different people now
    - â€¢	centralized information
    - â€¢	easy to access and check with - link to the existing messenger or email is also good for important notifications
    - â€¢	building from a [[bottom-up approach
    - â€¢	contextual approach for different usage instead of many group of different people now [[contextual usages]]
    - â€¢	[[centralized information]]
    - â€¢	easy to access and check with - link to the existing messenger or email is also good for important notifications [[bridging]]
    - what I concern about slack is losing old messages and not easy to bridge.
        - for file or document sharing, it would be good to store them no google drive or notions
        - for bridging, it's possible if there is a way to notify everyone on the channel.

- [[Articles - The 4 levels of personal knowledge management]]
- I have a bit [[attachment with money]] when I need to pay
for things that I don't pay usually, especially if it subscribes for a long
time. The reason is I'm not sure that will I really use it and fear that I
won't able to sustain it for long term. [[living in the future]]
    - Instead of that, I could just simply define what I really
need right now, and is it serve it? Not what I think I could have, but what I
will actually use. [[abundance appreciation]]
    - I'm spending my effort to create a mind-training course with
progressive approach.
    - Tiago Forte posts really stimulate me the deep knowledge
that it will take a long time for me to develop on my own.
    - 10$ subscribe is worth it as a content of a book. But now is
many articles instead.
    - I also can use Evernote if I want to store articles that I
haven't able to digest on the 1 month period, and don't need to pay next.
    - I will feel much freer if I focus on what it will really
serve me instead of the fear that comes from comparison and greedy by my ego.
[[fear of loss aversion]]
