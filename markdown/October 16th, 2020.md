    - I still feel that I want to mention to her a bit about how she defines herself based on the result as this would help her to improve her self awareness. My way is sharing my observation and ask for permission so that let her check her willingness to look deeper. [[helpful manner]]
    - My personal desire for this connection is at least I can support her to move through the beginning step for true inner journey and set up herself on certain important truths.
- I felt tired today and feel that I need to [[recharge]] my energy first.
- I noticed that I want to write a post about my [[coaching services]] so that I could get in touch and support with the suitable clients that need my help.

- I have a little bit [[worry]] about how logseq saves my notes, but I guess it will be fine and will test it more to refine this process.
