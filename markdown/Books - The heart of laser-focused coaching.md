    - Becoming a masterful coach
        - Things we already know about coaching
            - Coaching general understanding [[What is coaching?]]
                - Coaching emphasizes experiencing the present moment and shifting perspective and viewpoint. 
                    - Unlike some types of therapy, it doesn‚Äôt focus deeply on the past. The emphasis is on what is possible in the present looking toward the future.
                -  Coaching involves forming a partnership with your client to help them move forward in ways that are authentically satisfying. [[Coaching partnering]]
                    -  Satisfaction can come from resolving situations, dilemmas, conflicts, and concerns, and from figuring out how to create, grow, and expand.
                -  Coaching is about finding a way to change what isn‚Äôt working or improving on something that is working. 
                    - It addresses desires, problems, or situations in the present.
                - Coaching uses powerful techniques (tools, support, and structure) to help clients clarify and stay focused on their priorities.
                - The process of coaching can contribute to creating prosperity, balance, and fulfillment in all areas of life. 
                    - Through coaching, a client can achieve their vision (what they want in life) by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Each conversation moves the client closer to what they really want.
                    - Talking with a friend can be helpful, but coaching offers undistracted listening that is non-judgmental, trusting, honest, and exceptionally objective
                - A coach is a resource with a large tool kit for assisting clients in developing and pursuing their vision, so they achieve positive and permanent results. 
            - The coaching process can be broken down into three simple and easy steps: [[coaching process]]
                - 1. Identify the ideas, thoughts, or beliefs that keep your client from getting what they want. 
                - 2. Help them shift their perspective so that they can feel good about themselves and move forward. 
                - 3. Help them capitalize on their strengths to achieve fulfillment and their full potential.
            - Coaches accomplish this by finding out where their client is now, what their ideal situation is, and how to close the gap between the two. 
                - All coaching has the same focus ‚Äî to help the client:
                    -  Become more self-aware 
                    - Discover what is keeping them ‚Äústuck‚Äù 
                    - Create more prosperity, balance, and fulfillment in their life and/or work
        - [[Transformational Coaching]] approach
            - Major distinctions with general coaching
                - The coach truly focuses on the client ‚Äî who the person is, what they think is true, how they behave, and what they value. [[focus on the client as a whole]] [[coach the who]]
                - The coach is able to completely release the need to perform or prove their value. [[releasing personal needs]]
                    - As opposed to focusing on results, the intention is on purposeful exploration leading organically to long-term transformation that affects all areas of a client‚Äôs life.
                    - The client naturally creates their own forward movement from a highly motivated perspective. 
                        - From the literal first question, more profound, insightful coaching is underway.
                - Coach knows how to create and demonstrate a collaborative relationship by providing context for questions and pertinent reflection. [[Coaching partnering]]
                    - It‚Äôs not about focusing on solving the problematic situation because the solution is actually a by-product. 
                    - Trying to get to a solution or action plan before exploring the client‚Äôs thinking, behavior, ideas, and values is the same as asking an inappropriate question such as ‚ÄúHow much money do you make?‚Äù
                - Most people think coaching is about helping clients. While we do help them, that is not our aim in Laser-Focused Coaching.  [[What is coaching?]]
                    - __Our role is to shine a light on something our client cannot see for themselves. __
                        - And with that light, clients discover things they couldn‚Äôt see before, thus helping becomes the by-product .
        - CONVENTIONAL COACHING VERSUS LASERFOCUSED COACHING
            - The most common approach to coaching usually follows a learned formula or model to solve a problem.
                -  The focus is on action and results, making sure the client takes specific steps before the next session. 
                - Typical coaching starts with accepting at face value what the client shares. 
                    - Emphasis is frequently placed on agreeing on the outcome the client requests from the beginning, and then working toward that. 
                    - The coach typically assists the client in designing an action, and then manages accountability. 
                - With this type of coaching, the coach can feel pressure to perform and find solutions to be seen as worthy. 
                    - Often the coach fails to realize that they are not responsible for any outcome, and consequently gathers more information than is actually needed.
                        - This focus on collecting data prevents efficient and more meaningful coaching.
                - While the client might seem temporarily pleased, neither the coach nor the client realizes how much more could have come from the coaching had the underlying issue been addressed at the root.
            - [[Transformational Coaching]] or Laser-focused Coaching
                - relies on understanding the person, not their situation or problem. [[coach the who]]
                    - emphasizes coaching the ‚Äúwho‚Äù and separating the ‚Äúwho‚Äù from the client‚Äôs ‚Äústory‚Äù or situation.
                - A major distinction is that the __coach doesn‚Äôt automatically accept the client‚Äôs words as the truth, __because most of what we hear is likely that person‚Äôs perception of what is true. [[discerning truth from perception]]
                    - Learning how to distinguish truth from perception is the foundation of Laser-Focused Coaching.
                    -  It‚Äôs about uncovering the misconceptions to reveal the client‚Äôs own truth rather than what‚Äôs true for someone else .
                - Questions posed are consistently provocative and challenge the client‚Äôs thinking, [[Evokes awareness]] [[powerful questions]]
                    - while delving into the real meaning of what they‚Äôre about: their thinking, behavior, ideas, and values.
                - Laser-Focused Coaching is about going deeper, not broader; that is, getting to the bottom line efficiently and effectively. [[üå±Natural Progression]]
                    - It‚Äôs based on deep curiosity and respect for the uniqueness of another human being. 
                    - It‚Äôs not formulaic, but rather organic and natural. 
                - Laser-Focused Coaching refers to a specific coaching process to  [[Transformational Coaching]]
                    - quickly identify a greater truth 
                    - and provide information that can create an immediate change.
                - Coaching is never routine, and your client‚Äôs life is changed in profound ways. [[Why Transformational Coaching is effective?]]
                    - This isn‚Äôt because you have laid out a path for results. 
                        - It is because you have the skills to 
                            - listen in a unique way, 
                            - ask thought-provoking questions that expand their thinking, 
                            - and discover subconscious ideas that might be preventing progress.
                    - You offer a completely neutral, safe environment for them to determine their path in an organic way. 
                    - __The coach explores with the client until it becomes evident what the person really needs. __ [[üå±Natural Progression]]
                        - The initial exploration eclipses homing in on the agreement.
                        - Because the coaching goes deep, your client naturally 
                            - creates their own action(s) 
                            - and is highly motivated to create 
                                - their own supportive environment to sustain the action(s) they have chosen.
                    - Laser-Focused Coaching allows a client to: [[Benefits of Transformational Coaching]]
                        - Move beyond perceived obstacles 
                        - Discover what they really want and need (which often is not the initial desire they voiced)
                        - Realize a new perspective in thinking that is so powerful they can‚Äôt go back to their original thinking 
                        - Learn the art of surrounding themselves with people who truly support them 
                        - Organically design their own plan for creating their desired experiences and outcomes 
                        - Achieve meaningful, consistent results that are long-lasting and impact other aspects of their life
                - Example of the difference between conventional-coaching and transformational coaching [[Coaching examples]]
                    - Leah came to her coaching session and said, ‚ÄúI feel vulnerable about my situation and it‚Äôs difficult to share this.‚Äù She then launched into, ‚ÄúI want to talk about my daughter and the problems she‚Äôs having on her swim team. I‚Äôm not sure if I should have her coached privately by an outside person or have the swim team coach work with her.‚Äù
                        - Conventional Approach
                            - ‚ÄúThanks for sharing. What would be a good outcome for our conversation?‚Äù 
                            - Leah responds that she wants to make a decision. 
                            - ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at some pros and cons to see which coach would be best for your daughter. What are some reasons for getting an outside person?‚Äù 
                            - This approach is not wrong; it‚Äôs just not exceptional or life- changing. 
                                - It deals with Leah‚Äôs symptoms, which might be temporarily alleviated (choosing the best coach for her daughter), 
                                - but it does not get to the root of the issue like the Laser-Focused approach (Leah‚Äôs deeper concerns about her daughter). 
                                - By choosing to pursue the pros and cons, the coach was focused on their own agenda rather than Leah‚Äôs agenda by choosing how to begin.
                        - Laser-Focused Approach 
                            - ‚ÄúI understand you want to talk about your daughter and the swim team. I‚Äôm curious as to what‚Äôs making you feel vulnerable and having difficulty sharing?‚Äù 
                            - Leah responds that she‚Äôs concerned that her daughter might be in some kind of trouble and may be cut from the team. 
                            - ‚ÄúI can understand how worrisome this is. What would that mean for you?‚Äù
                            - The Laser-Focused coach acknowledged what Leah wanted and immediately picked up on and questioned her emotion. 
                                - The first question the coach asked was ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs making you feel vulnerable and having difficulty sharing?‚Äù 
                                    - Right off the bat, this question didn‚Äôt ignore why Leah shared what she did. 
                                        - Her seemingly offhand comment had to be relevant, and because the opening sentiment wasn‚Äôt ignored, the coach was able to get to the heart of the matter rather quickly.
                                    - Then the coach acknowledged Leah‚Äôs concern and asked a question specifically addressing her ‚Äî not the daughter or the decision. 
                                        - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs making you feel vulnerable‚Ä¶?‚Äù
                                    - In Leah‚Äôs case, it might have been that she believed her child‚Äôs progress was a reflection of her own worth. Perhaps Leah struggled in school and is triggered by painful memories. Or it might have been some other reason entirely.
                    - The aim of a Laser-Focused coaching session is [[Goals of Transformational Coaching]]
                        - to understand the client, 
                        - explore what is troubling about their situation 
                        - and ascertain how they would like to feel instead.
                        - This helps them discover what thoughts or ideas are in the way of that.
