    - Becoming a masterful coach
        - Things we already know about coaching
            - Coaching general understanding [[What is coaching?]]
                - Coaching emphasizes experiencing the present moment and shifting perspective and viewpoint. 
                    - Unlike some types of therapy, it doesn‚Äôt focus deeply on the past. The emphasis is on what is possible in the present looking toward the future.
                -  Coaching involves forming a partnership with your client to help them move forward in ways that are authentically satisfying. [[Coaching partnering]]
                    -  Satisfaction can come from resolving situations, dilemmas, conflicts, and concerns, and from figuring out how to create, grow, and expand.
                -  Coaching is about finding a way to change what isn‚Äôt working or improving on something that is working. 
                    - It addresses desires, problems, or situations in the present.
                - Coaching uses powerful techniques (tools, support, and structure) to help clients clarify and stay focused on their priorities.
                - The process of coaching can contribute to creating prosperity, balance, and fulfillment in all areas of life. 
                    - Through coaching, a client can achieve their vision (what they want in life) by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Each conversation moves the client closer to what they really want.
                    - Talking with a friend can be helpful, but coaching offers undistracted listening that is non-judgmental, trusting, honest, and exceptionally objective
                - A coach is a resource with a large tool kit for assisting clients in developing and pursuing their vision, so they achieve positive and permanent results. 
            - The coaching process can be broken down into three simple and easy steps: [[coaching process]]
                - 1. Identify the ideas, thoughts, or beliefs that keep your client from getting what they want. 
                - 2. Help them shift their perspective so that they can feel good about themselves and move forward. 
                - 3. Help them capitalize on their strengths to achieve fulfillment and their full potential.
            - Coaches accomplish this by finding out where their client is now, what their ideal situation is, and how to close the gap between the two. 
                - All coaching has the same focus ‚Äî to help the client:
                    -  Become more self-aware 
                    - Discover what is keeping them ‚Äústuck‚Äù 
                    - Create more prosperity, balance, and fulfillment in their life and/or work
        - [[Transformational Coaching]] approach
            - Major distinctions with general coaching
                - The coach truly focuses on the client ‚Äî who the person is, what they think is true, how they behave, and what they value. [[focus on the client as a whole]] [[coach the who]]
                - The coach is able to completely release the need to perform or prove their value. [[releasing personal needs]]
                    - As opposed to focusing on results, the intention is on purposeful exploration leading organically to long-term transformation that affects all areas of a client‚Äôs life.
                    - The client naturally creates their own forward movement from a highly motivated perspective. 
                        - From the literal first question, more profound, insightful coaching is underway.
                - Coach knows how to create and demonstrate a collaborative relationship by providing context for questions and pertinent reflection. [[Coaching partnering]]
                    - It‚Äôs not about focusing on solving the problematic situation because the solution is actually a by-product. 
                    - Trying to get to a solution or action plan before exploring the client‚Äôs thinking, behavior, ideas, and values is the same as asking an inappropriate question such as ‚ÄúHow much money do you make?‚Äù
                - Most people think coaching is about helping clients. While we do help them, that is not our aim in Laser-Focused Coaching.  [[What is coaching?]]
                    - __Our role is to shine a light on something our client cannot see for themselves. __
                        - And with that light, clients discover things they couldn‚Äôt see before, thus helping becomes the by-product .
        - CONVENTIONAL COACHING VERSUS LASERFOCUSED COACHING
            - The most common approach to coaching usually follows a learned formula or model to solve a problem.
                -  The focus is on action and results, making sure the client takes specific steps before the next session. 
                - Typical coaching starts with accepting at face value what the client shares. 
                    - Emphasis is frequently placed on agreeing on the outcome the client requests from the beginning, and then working toward that. 
                    - The coach typically assists the client in designing an action, and then manages accountability. 
                - With this type of coaching, the coach can feel pressure to perform and find solutions to be seen as worthy. 
                    - Often the coach fails to realize that they are not responsible for any outcome, and consequently gathers more information than is actually needed.
                        - This focus on collecting data prevents efficient and more meaningful coaching.
                - While the client might seem temporarily pleased, neither the coach nor the client realizes how much more could have come from the coaching had the underlying issue been addressed at the root.
            - [[Transformational Coaching]] or Laser-focused Coaching
                - relies on understanding the person, not their situation or problem. [[coach the who]]
                    - emphasizes coaching the ‚Äúwho‚Äù and separating the ‚Äúwho‚Äù from the client‚Äôs ‚Äústory‚Äù or situation.
                - A major distinction is that the __coach doesn‚Äôt automatically accept the client‚Äôs words as the truth, __because most of what we hear is likely that person‚Äôs perception of what is true. [[discerning truth from perception]]
                    - Learning how to distinguish truth from perception is the foundation of Laser-Focused Coaching.
                    -  It‚Äôs about uncovering the misconceptions to reveal the client‚Äôs own truth rather than what‚Äôs true for someone else .
                - Questions posed are consistently provocative and challenge the client‚Äôs thinking, [[Evokes awareness]] [[powerful questions]]
                    - while delving into the real meaning of what they‚Äôre about: their thinking, behavior, ideas, and values.
                - Laser-Focused Coaching is about going deeper, not broader; that is, getting to the bottom line efficiently and effectively. [[üå±Natural Progression]]
                    - It‚Äôs based on deep curiosity and respect for the uniqueness of another human being. 
                    - It‚Äôs not formulaic, but rather organic and natural. 
                - Laser-Focused Coaching refers to a specific coaching process to  [[Transformational Coaching]]
                    - quickly identify a greater truth 
                    - and provide information that can create an immediate change.
                - Coaching is never routine, and your client‚Äôs life is changed in profound ways. [[Why Transformational Coaching is effective?]]
                    - This isn‚Äôt because you have laid out a path for results. 
                        - It is because you have the skills to 
                            - listen in a unique way, 
                            - ask thought-provoking questions that expand their thinking, 
                            - and discover subconscious ideas that might be preventing progress.
                    - You offer a completely neutral, safe environment for them to determine their path in an organic way. 
                    - __The coach explores with the client until it becomes evident what the person really needs. __ [[üå±Natural Progression]]
                        - The initial exploration eclipses homing in on the agreement.
                        - Because the coaching goes deep, your client naturally 
                            - creates their own action(s) 
                            - and is highly motivated to create 
                                - their own supportive environment to sustain the action(s) they have chosen.
                    - Laser-Focused Coaching allows a client to: [[Benefits of Transformational Coaching]]
                        - Move beyond perceived obstacles 
                        - Discover what they really want and need (which often is not the initial desire they voiced)
                        - Realize a new perspective in thinking that is so powerful they can‚Äôt go back to their original thinking 
                        - Learn the art of surrounding themselves with people who truly support them 
                        - Organically design their own plan for creating their desired experiences and outcomes 
                        - Achieve meaningful, consistent results that are long-lasting and impact other aspects of their life
                - Example of the difference between conventional-coaching and transformational coaching [[Coaching examples]]
                    - Leah came to her coaching session and said, ‚ÄúI feel vulnerable about my situation and it‚Äôs difficult to share this.‚Äù She then launched into, ‚ÄúI want to talk about my daughter and the problems she‚Äôs having on her swim team. I‚Äôm not sure if I should have her coached privately by an outside person or have the swim team coach work with her.‚Äù
                        - Conventional Approach
                            - ‚ÄúThanks for sharing. What would be a good outcome for our conversation?‚Äù 
                            - Leah responds that she wants to make a decision. 
                            - ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at some pros and cons to see which coach would be best for your daughter. What are some reasons for getting an outside person?‚Äù 
                            - This approach is not wrong; it‚Äôs just not exceptional or life- changing. 
                                - It deals with Leah‚Äôs symptoms, which might be temporarily alleviated (choosing the best coach for her daughter), 
                                - but it does not get to the root of the issue like the Laser-Focused approach (Leah‚Äôs deeper concerns about her daughter). 
                                - By choosing to pursue the pros and cons, the coach was focused on their own agenda rather than Leah‚Äôs agenda by choosing how to begin.
                        - Laser-Focused Approach 
                            - ‚ÄúI understand you want to talk about your daughter and the swim team. I‚Äôm curious as to what‚Äôs making you feel vulnerable and having difficulty sharing?‚Äù 
                            - Leah responds that she‚Äôs concerned that her daughter might be in some kind of trouble and may be cut from the team. 
                            - ‚ÄúI can understand how worrisome this is. What would that mean for you?‚Äù
                            - The Laser-Focused coach acknowledged what Leah wanted and immediately picked up on and questioned her emotion. 
                                - The first question the coach asked was ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs making you feel vulnerable and having difficulty sharing?‚Äù 
                                    - Right off the bat, this question didn‚Äôt ignore why Leah shared what she did. 
                                        - Her seemingly offhand comment had to be relevant, and because the opening sentiment wasn‚Äôt ignored, the coach was able to get to the heart of the matter rather quickly.
                                    - Then the coach acknowledged Leah‚Äôs concern and asked a question specifically addressing her ‚Äî not the daughter or the decision. 
                                        - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs making you feel vulnerable‚Ä¶?‚Äù
                                    - In Leah‚Äôs case, it might have been that she believed her child‚Äôs progress was a reflection of her own worth. Perhaps Leah struggled in school and is triggered by painful memories. Or it might have been some other reason entirely.
                    - The aim of a Laser-Focused coaching session is [[Goals of Transformational Coaching]]
                        - to understand the client, 
                        - explore what is troubling about their situation 
                        - and ascertain how they would like to feel instead.
                        - This helps them discover what thoughts or ideas are in the way of that.
- ## Part II - The beginning
- ### Chapter 2 - The laser-focused mindset [[Maintains Presence]] [[Embodies a Coaching Mindset]]
    - Everything begins with the right mindset and it‚Äôs just as important as the actual coaching. [[Embodies a Coaching Mindset]]
        - In coaching, it is the ability to presence of the coach
    - Key elements for developing true coaching presence [[Coaching Presence key elements]]
        - [[Be empty]] [[trust the process]]
            - Blank Slate
                - a completely objective person without expectations of any kind,
                    - someone free of preconceived ideas about what is coming or what ‚Äúshould‚Äù happen.
                    - They are flexible, open to whatever shows up, and able to move in whatever direction is needed
                - The reason for this mindset is to allow them to be authentic and natural, which in turn releases the inclination to perform or be brilliant in order to be effective.
                    - __Trying to be brilliant gets in the way of good listening and creating a true breakthrough for your client.__
            - Not Knowing 
                - Coming to the conversation not knowing anything and trusting that whatever you need to know will show up. 
                - If you have preconceived notions or concerns about how your session will turn out, you will be concerned with doing everything right.
                - Be willing to be wrong about any attitude or belief. 
                    - You might ask a question that is totally off base, yet it could allow your client to see the situation clearly. A question that seems off base is not an error. 
                    - Instead, it shows that you‚Äôre curious and could even lead to clarity for your client.
                - __Success comes from letting go of the need to provide value or reach a specific outcome.__
                - 3 important trust
                    - Trust in the process of coaching. 
                    - Trust in your client. 
                    - Trust in yourself
                        - IT ALL BEGINS WITH YOU
                            - No matter how seasoned or brilliant a coach is, there will still be moments of having no idea where the conversation is going.
                            - The difference for experienced coaches is that they know they can trust the process and the idea of not knowing isn‚Äôt uncomfortable.
                            - The key to meaningful coaching is to let go of these moments of not knowing and trust yourself, your client, and the process. 
                                - While it might seem counterintuitive, part of trusting in the process is about
                                    - trusting that what you have learned will show up naturally, 
                                    - and that no matter how doubtful you are, it will turn out well.
                            - Some coaches feel like they have ‚Äúimposter syndrome.‚Äù They believe they don‚Äôt provide enough value to make a significant difference or warrant getting paid.
                                - It‚Äôs important to know that you bring great value to your client 
                                    - when you listen, 
                                    - ask questions about who they are, 
                                    - and then help them work with that information.
                            - __Learn to trust yourself ‚Äî no matter what.__
        - YOUR PRESENCE AS A COACH [[coaching presence]]
            - To be presence means to focus on what you're hearing
                - As long as you‚Äôre open, non-judgmental, curious about the person, undistracted, and focused on listening to what is said and what is not said, you are present.
                - When you speak with your client, it‚Äôs important to be fully conscious and create a spontaneous relationship. Be open, flexible, and appear confident even when you don‚Äôt feel that way. [[spontaenous]]
                - As a coach, there will be times in the conversation when your own thoughts will be distracting, confusing, or filled with doubt. Notice those thoughts and return your attention to listening to your client. [[regain presence]]
                    - As you gain more experience using transformational techniques, those doubts and lack of trust in the process begin to melt away.
                    - If you find yourself becoming anxious because you don‚Äôt know where the conversation is going, refocus on deep listening and ask your client what is needed. For example, you can simply ask, ‚ÄúWhat would be most helpful at this point?‚Äù
                - Think of it like a movie with a sudden plot twist that takes you by surprise. [[emergence child-like mindset]]
                    - It‚Äôs the same when your client is telling a story that is familiar; you have to be prepared for a twist so you can remain connected. 
                    - Masterful coaching means that at any moment in the conversation you have absolutely, positively no clue where the conversation will end up; you are simply following the client‚Äôs responses to your questions.
        - LET GO OF THE FORMULAS
            - Masterful coaching does not have an explicit formula or model. Instead, it‚Äôs organic in nature as you respond naturally to what your client offers. [[Listens Actively]]
            - It‚Äôs important that the conversation is flowing, organic, and natural. 
                - Don‚Äôt use industry jargon; you should never need to explain a word or expression to your client. Use everyday language, just as you would with a friend over lunch.
            - Great questions arise from great listening, they don‚Äôt arise from a list. [[Listens Actively]]
                - You are responding to what your client presents instead of making them respond to what you present.
            - In a masterful coaching session, awareness is created constantly, consistently, and throughout the conversation. [[Evokes awareness]]
                - It is often described as coming in waves. 
                - The client‚Äôs awareness can come from your: 
                    - Reflection (your interpretation) 
                    - A challenging question 
                    - An observation 
                    - Intuition 
                    - Silence 
                    - Feedback provided by the coach
                - rely on being present, attuning to your client, and following the trail of breadcrumbs they leave for you.
                    - the ‚Äúahas!‚Äù come in small, subtle waves that build over the course of the conversation.
        - BE FRIENDLY, NOT FRIENDS 
            - As a coach, you are a professional, objective outsider with permission to be direct.
            - how do you stay friendly and not become a friend? 
                - Focus the conversation on your client, not on you. 
                    - When you do this well, you don‚Äôt get sucked into their emotions or the details about their situation. 
                    - In general, don‚Äôt bring your experiences or opinions into the conversation unless they‚Äôre based on something your client shared, no matter how tempting it might be.
                - Remain professional with your client. [[coach proferssional boundary]]
                    - Avoid looking to them to fulfill your personal needs, such as the need to socialize, to be liked, to be praised, etc. 
                    - Refrain from agreeing with them or comparing yourself to their situation, as this can get in the way of your role as the objective listener. 
                    - Even if you strongly identify with them or have had a similar experience, use what you learned from your situation to question them without mentioning how you learned it.
                - Friendly means staying objective and enjoying your client. It doesn‚Äôt mean sharing and commiserating the way friends do.
        - BE YOUR OWN COACH FIRST [[Live Deeply]]
            - Becoming truly masterful is to work on your own problems.
                - That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean solving them completely; it means continually working on your personal development and growth.
                - use your clients‚Äô challenges as a springboard for working on areas you need to focus on.
                    - For instance, if your client is challenged by boundaries, it‚Äôs an opportunity to look at your own boundaries and note where some work might be needed.
        - YOUR EGO AND THE USE OF ‚ÄúI‚Äù [[Coach from the soul, not the ego]]
            - It‚Äôs important to __keep the word I out of the coaching conversation__ as much as possible. 
                - Your client doesn‚Äôt need your advice or to hear about something that worked for you.
            - __You may right, but your client is always right.__ [[Embodies a Coaching Mindset]]
                - For example, your client states, ‚ÄúThe grass is purple.‚Äù Instead of contradicting them, ask the question ‚ÄúWhat has you coming to that conclusion?‚Äù In other words, don‚Äôt make them wrong or set up barriers.
                - Letting them explain doesn‚Äôt mean you agree with them. 
                    - It means you respect their different point of view. 
                    - Give them the space to explore their ideas so that you get closer to the root of their beliefs and stories.
            - Our work as coaches is to be of service. [[Embodies a Coaching Mindset]]
