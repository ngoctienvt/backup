    - Becoming a masterful coach
        - Things we already know about coaching
            - Coaching general understanding [[What is coaching?]]
                - Coaching emphasizes experiencing the present moment and shifting perspective and viewpoint. 
                    - Unlike some types of therapy, it doesn‚Äôt focus deeply on the past. The emphasis is on what is possible in the present looking toward the future.
                -  Coaching involves forming a partnership with your client to help them move forward in ways that are authentically satisfying. [[Coaching partnering]]
                    -  Satisfaction can come from resolving situations, dilemmas, conflicts, and concerns, and from figuring out how to create, grow, and expand.
                -  Coaching is about finding a way to change what isn‚Äôt working or improving on something that is working. 
                    - It addresses desires, problems, or situations in the present.
                - Coaching uses powerful techniques (tools, support, and structure) to help clients clarify and stay focused on their priorities.
                - The process of coaching can contribute to creating prosperity, balance, and fulfillment in all areas of life. 
                    - Through coaching, a client can achieve their vision (what they want in life) by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Each conversation moves the client closer to what they really want.
                    - Talking with a friend can be helpful, but coaching offers undistracted listening that is non-judgmental, trusting, honest, and exceptionally objective
                - A coach is a resource with a large tool kit for assisting clients in developing and pursuing their vision, so they achieve positive and permanent results. 
            - The coaching process can be broken down into three simple and easy steps: [[coaching process]]
                - 1. Identify the ideas, thoughts, or beliefs that keep your client from getting what they want. 
                - 2. Help them shift their perspective so that they can feel good about themselves and move forward. 
                - 3. Help them capitalize on their strengths to achieve fulfillment and their full potential.
            - Coaches accomplish this by finding out where their client is now, what their ideal situation is, and how to close the gap between the two. 
                - All coaching has the same focus ‚Äî to help the client:
                    -  Become more self-aware 
                    - Discover what is keeping them ‚Äústuck‚Äù 
                    - Create more prosperity, balance, and fulfillment in their life and/or work
        - [[Transformational Coaching]] approach
            - Major distinctions with general coaching
                - The coach truly focuses on the client ‚Äî who the person is, what they think is true, how they behave, and what they value. [[focus on the client as a whole]] [[coach the who]]
                - The coach is able to completely release the need to perform or prove their value. [[releasing personal needs]]
                    - As opposed to focusing on results, the intention is on purposeful exploration leading organically to long-term transformation that affects all areas of a client‚Äôs life.
                    - The client naturally creates their own forward movement from a highly motivated perspective. 
                        - From the literal first question, more profound, insightful coaching is underway.
                - Coach knows how to create and demonstrate a collaborative relationship by providing context for questions and pertinent reflection. [[Coaching partnering]]
                    - It‚Äôs not about focusing on solving the problematic situation because the solution is actually a by-product. 
                    - Trying to get to a solution or action plan before exploring the client‚Äôs thinking, behavior, ideas, and values is the same as asking an inappropriate question such as ‚ÄúHow much money do you make?‚Äù
                - Most people think coaching is about helping clients. While we do help them, that is not our aim in Laser-Focused Coaching.  [[What is coaching?]]
                    - __Our role is to shine a light on something our client cannot see for themselves. __
                        - And with that light, clients discover things they couldn‚Äôt see before, thus helping becomes the by-product .
        - CONVENTIONAL COACHING VERSUS LASERFOCUSED COACHING
            - The most common approach to coaching usually follows a learned formula or model to solve a problem.
                -  The focus is on action and results, making sure the client takes specific steps before the next session. 
                - Typical coaching starts with accepting at face value what the client shares. 
                    - Emphasis is frequently placed on agreeing on the outcome the client requests from the beginning, and then working toward that. 
                    - The coach typically assists the client in designing an action, and then manages accountability. 
                - With this type of coaching, the coach can feel pressure to perform and find solutions to be seen as worthy. 
                    - Often the coach fails to realize that they are not responsible for any outcome, and consequently gathers more information than is actually needed.
                        - This focus on collecting data prevents efficient and more meaningful coaching.
                - While the client might seem temporarily pleased, neither the coach nor the client realizes how much more could have come from the coaching had the underlying issue been addressed at the root.
            - [[Transformational Coaching]] or Laser-focused Coaching
                - relies on understanding the person, not their situation or problem. [[coach the who]]
                    - emphasizes coaching the ‚Äúwho‚Äù and separating the ‚Äúwho‚Äù from the client‚Äôs ‚Äústory‚Äù or situation.
                - A major distinction is that the __coach doesn‚Äôt automatically accept the client‚Äôs words as the truth, __because most of what we hear is likely that person‚Äôs perception of what is true. [[discerning truth from perception]]
                    - Learning how to distinguish truth from perception is the foundation of Laser-Focused Coaching.
                    -  It‚Äôs about uncovering the misconceptions to reveal the client‚Äôs own truth rather than what‚Äôs true for someone else .
                - Questions posed are consistently provocative and challenge the client‚Äôs thinking, [[Evokes awareness]] [[powerful questions]]
                    - while delving into the real meaning of what they‚Äôre about: their thinking, behavior, ideas, and values.
                - Laser-Focused Coaching is about going deeper, not broader; that is, getting to the bottom line efficiently and effectively. [[üå±Natural Progression]]
                    - It‚Äôs based on deep curiosity and respect for the uniqueness of another human being. 
                    - It‚Äôs not formulaic, but rather organic and natural. 
                - Laser-Focused Coaching refers to a specific coaching process to  [[Transformational Coaching]]
                    - quickly identify a greater truth 
                    - and provide information that can create an immediate change.
                - Coaching is never routine, and your client‚Äôs life is changed in profound ways. [[Why Transformational Coaching is effective?]]
                    - This isn‚Äôt because you have laid out a path for results. 
                        - It is because you have the skills to 
                            - listen in a unique way, 
                            - ask thought-provoking questions that expand their thinking, 
                            - and discover subconscious ideas that might be preventing progress.
                    - You offer a completely neutral, safe environment for them to determine their path in an organic way. 
                    - __The coach explores with the client until it becomes evident what the person really needs. __ [[üå±Natural Progression]]
                        - The initial exploration eclipses homing in on the agreement.
                        - Because the coaching goes deep, your client naturally 
                            - creates their own action(s) 
                            - and is highly motivated to create 
                                - their own supportive environment to sustain the action(s) they have chosen.
                    - Laser-Focused Coaching allows a client to: [[Benefits of Transformational Coaching]]
                        - Move beyond perceived obstacles 
                        - Discover what they really want and need (which often is not the initial desire they voiced)
                        - Realize a new perspective in thinking that is so powerful they can‚Äôt go back to their original thinking 
                        - Learn the art of surrounding themselves with people who truly support them 
                        - Organically design their own plan for creating their desired experiences and outcomes 
                        - Achieve meaningful, consistent results that are long-lasting and impact other aspects of their life
                - Example of the difference between conventional-coaching and transformational coaching [[Coaching examples]]
                    - Leah came to her coaching session and said, ‚ÄúI feel vulnerable about my situation and it‚Äôs difficult to share this.‚Äù She then launched into, ‚ÄúI want to talk about my daughter and the problems she‚Äôs having on her swim team. I‚Äôm not sure if I should have her coached privately by an outside person or have the swim team coach work with her.‚Äù
                        - Conventional Approach
                            - ‚ÄúThanks for sharing. What would be a good outcome for our conversation?‚Äù 
                            - Leah responds that she wants to make a decision. 
                            - ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at some pros and cons to see which coach would be best for your daughter. What are some reasons for getting an outside person?‚Äù 
                            - This approach is not wrong; it‚Äôs just not exceptional or life- changing. 
                                - It deals with Leah‚Äôs symptoms, which might be temporarily alleviated (choosing the best coach for her daughter), 
                                - but it does not get to the root of the issue like the Laser-Focused approach (Leah‚Äôs deeper concerns about her daughter). 
                                - By choosing to pursue the pros and cons, the coach was focused on their own agenda rather than Leah‚Äôs agenda by choosing how to begin.
                        - Laser-Focused Approach 
                            - ‚ÄúI understand you want to talk about your daughter and the swim team. I‚Äôm curious as to what‚Äôs making you feel vulnerable and having difficulty sharing?‚Äù 
                            - Leah responds that she‚Äôs concerned that her daughter might be in some kind of trouble and may be cut from the team. 
                            - ‚ÄúI can understand how worrisome this is. What would that mean for you?‚Äù
                            - The Laser-Focused coach acknowledged what Leah wanted and immediately picked up on and questioned her emotion. 
                                - The first question the coach asked was ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs making you feel vulnerable and having difficulty sharing?‚Äù 
                                    - Right off the bat, this question didn‚Äôt ignore why Leah shared what she did. 
                                        - Her seemingly offhand comment had to be relevant, and because the opening sentiment wasn‚Äôt ignored, the coach was able to get to the heart of the matter rather quickly.
                                    - Then the coach acknowledged Leah‚Äôs concern and asked a question specifically addressing her ‚Äî not the daughter or the decision. 
                                        - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs making you feel vulnerable‚Ä¶?‚Äù
                                    - In Leah‚Äôs case, it might have been that she believed her child‚Äôs progress was a reflection of her own worth. Perhaps Leah struggled in school and is triggered by painful memories. Or it might have been some other reason entirely.
                    - The aim of a Laser-Focused coaching session is [[Goals of Transformational Coaching]]
                        - to understand the client, 
                        - explore what is troubling about their situation 
                        - and ascertain how they would like to feel instead.
                        - This helps them discover what thoughts or ideas are in the way of that.
- ## Part II - The beginning
- ### Chapter 2 - The laser-focused mindset [[Maintains Presence]] [[Embodies a Coaching Mindset]]
    - Everything begins with the right mindset and it‚Äôs just as important as the actual coaching. [[Embodies a Coaching Mindset]]
        - In coaching, it is the ability to presence of the coach
    - Key elements for developing true coaching presence [[Coaching Presence key elements]]
        - [[Be empty]] [[trust the process]]
            - Blank Slate
                - a completely objective person without expectations of any kind,
                    - someone free of preconceived ideas about what is coming or what ‚Äúshould‚Äù happen.
                    - They are flexible, open to whatever shows up, and able to move in whatever direction is needed
                - The reason for this mindset is to allow them to be authentic and natural, which in turn releases the inclination to perform or be brilliant in order to be effective.
                    - __Trying to be brilliant gets in the way of good listening and creating a true breakthrough for your client.__
            - Not Knowing 
                - Coming to the conversation not knowing anything and trusting that whatever you need to know will show up. 
                - If you have preconceived notions or concerns about how your session will turn out, you will be concerned with doing everything right.
                - Be willing to be wrong about any attitude or belief. 
                    - You might ask a question that is totally off base, yet it could allow your client to see the situation clearly. A question that seems off base is not an error. 
                    - Instead, it shows that you‚Äôre curious and could even lead to clarity for your client.
                - __Success comes from letting go of the need to provide value or reach a specific outcome.__
                - 3 important trust
                    - Trust in the process of coaching. 
                    - Trust in your client. 
                    - Trust in yourself
                        - IT ALL BEGINS WITH YOU
                            - No matter how seasoned or brilliant a coach is, there will still be moments of having no idea where the conversation is going.
                            - The difference for experienced coaches is that they know they can trust the process and the idea of not knowing isn‚Äôt uncomfortable.
                            - The key to meaningful coaching is to let go of these moments of not knowing and trust yourself, your client, and the process. 
                                - While it might seem counterintuitive, part of trusting in the process is about
                                    - trusting that what you have learned will show up naturally, 
                                    - and that no matter how doubtful you are, it will turn out well.
                            - Some coaches feel like they have ‚Äúimposter syndrome.‚Äù They believe they don‚Äôt provide enough value to make a significant difference or warrant getting paid.
                                - It‚Äôs important to know that you bring great value to your client 
                                    - when you listen, 
                                    - ask questions about who they are, 
                                    - and then help them work with that information.
                            - __Learn to trust yourself ‚Äî no matter what.__
        - YOUR PRESENCE AS A COACH [[coaching presence]]
            - To be presence means to focus on what you're hearing
                - As long as you‚Äôre open, non-judgmental, curious about the person, undistracted, and focused on listening to what is said and what is not said, you are present.
                - When you speak with your client, it‚Äôs important to be fully conscious and create a spontaneous relationship. Be open, flexible, and appear confident even when you don‚Äôt feel that way. [[spontaenous]]
                - As a coach, there will be times in the conversation when your own thoughts will be distracting, confusing, or filled with doubt. Notice those thoughts and return your attention to listening to your client. [[regain presence]]
                    - As you gain more experience using transformational techniques, those doubts and lack of trust in the process begin to melt away.
                    - If you find yourself becoming anxious because you don‚Äôt know where the conversation is going, refocus on deep listening and ask your client what is needed. For example, you can simply ask, ‚ÄúWhat would be most helpful at this point?‚Äù
                - Think of it like a movie with a sudden plot twist that takes you by surprise. [[emergence child-like mindset]]
                    - It‚Äôs the same when your client is telling a story that is familiar; you have to be prepared for a twist so you can remain connected. 
                    - Masterful coaching means that at any moment in the conversation you have absolutely, positively no clue where the conversation will end up; you are simply following the client‚Äôs responses to your questions.
        - LET GO OF THE FORMULAS
            - Masterful coaching does not have an explicit formula or model. Instead, it‚Äôs organic in nature as you respond naturally to what your client offers. [[Listens Actively]]
            - It‚Äôs important that the conversation is flowing, organic, and natural. 
                - Don‚Äôt use industry jargon; you should never need to explain a word or expression to your client. Use everyday language, just as you would with a friend over lunch.
            - Great questions arise from great listening, they don‚Äôt arise from a list. [[Listens Actively]]
                - You are responding to what your client presents instead of making them respond to what you present.
            - In a masterful coaching session, awareness is created constantly, consistently, and throughout the conversation. [[Evokes awareness]]
                - It is often described as coming in waves. 
                - The client‚Äôs awareness can come from your: 
                    - Reflection (your interpretation) 
                    - A challenging question 
                    - An observation 
                    - Intuition 
                    - Silence 
                    - Feedback provided by the coach
                - rely on being present, attuning to your client, and following the trail of breadcrumbs they leave for you.
                    - the ‚Äúahas!‚Äù come in small, subtle waves that build over the course of the conversation.
        - BE FRIENDLY, NOT FRIENDS 
            - As a coach, you are a professional, objective outsider with permission to be direct.
            - how do you stay friendly and not become a friend? 
                - Focus the conversation on your client, not on you. 
                    - When you do this well, you don‚Äôt get sucked into their emotions or the details about their situation. 
                    - In general, don‚Äôt bring your experiences or opinions into the conversation unless they‚Äôre based on something your client shared, no matter how tempting it might be.
                - Remain professional with your client. [[coach proferssional boundary]]
                    - Avoid looking to them to fulfill your personal needs, such as the need to socialize, to be liked, to be praised, etc. 
                    - Refrain from agreeing with them or comparing yourself to their situation, as this can get in the way of your role as the objective listener. 
                    - Even if you strongly identify with them or have had a similar experience, use what you learned from your situation to question them without mentioning how you learned it.
                - Friendly means staying objective and enjoying your client. It doesn‚Äôt mean sharing and commiserating the way friends do.
        - BE YOUR OWN COACH FIRST [[Live Deeply]]
            - Becoming truly masterful is to work on your own problems.
                - That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean solving them completely; it means continually working on your personal development and growth.
                - use your clients‚Äô challenges as a springboard for working on areas you need to focus on.
                    - For instance, if your client is challenged by boundaries, it‚Äôs an opportunity to look at your own boundaries and note where some work might be needed.
        - YOUR EGO AND THE USE OF ‚ÄúI‚Äù [[Coach from the soul, not the ego]]
            - It‚Äôs important to __keep the word I out of the coaching conversation__ as much as possible. 
                - Your client doesn‚Äôt need your advice or to hear about something that worked for you.
            - __You may right, but your client is always right.__ [[Embodies a Coaching Mindset]]
                - For example, your client states, ‚ÄúThe grass is purple.‚Äù Instead of contradicting them, ask the question ‚ÄúWhat has you coming to that conclusion?‚Äù In other words, don‚Äôt make them wrong or set up barriers.
                - Letting them explain doesn‚Äôt mean you agree with them. 
                    - It means you respect their different point of view. 
                    - Give them the space to explore their ideas so that you get closer to the root of their beliefs and stories.
            - Our work as coaches is to be of service. [[Embodies a Coaching Mindset]]
                - If we try to help or fix them, we are making a judgment that the person is broken. 
                - Helping and fixing lead only in one direction; they are draining, and they keep us from serving the dream in other people. 
                - They imply that we don‚Äôt trust the person‚Äôs potential and that we have more expertise. 
                - A good message for your clients is ‚ÄúYour life matters.‚Äù 
                    - We want them to understand that who we are is as important as what we do.
            - The coach‚Äôs focus is to be of service and to serve clients from our soul and not from our ego.
                - When you‚Äôre able to come to session with presence, an open mind, and a commitment to remaining neutral, your clients flourish. 
                    - They feel more comfortable exploring their deeply held beliefs and perceptions because they know you won‚Äôt judge them or force them into anything.
- ### Chapter 3 - Listen with new intent
    - WHAT GETS IN THE WAY OF DEEP LISTENING?
        - Our minds take us away from pure listening. It‚Äôs natural to fill in the blanks, or have ideas that are not relevant or true, all while someone is talking.
        - When you‚Äôre not really listening: 
            - You might miss important information. 
            - You can lose patience and want to jump right to a solution. 
            - You could feel embarrassed that you haven‚Äôt really been listening deeply and want to say something you think is brilliant to prove that you‚Äôve been paying attention after all. 
            - You could get distracted and go off on a tangent.
        - Suzanne comes to the session complaining bitterly about her mother. She says her mother calls her every morning, during the workday, and every evening. She laments that she really wants her mother to stop calling so often. 
            - Many coaches will start to think things like: 
                - Does she want to work on this, or she is just venting? 
                - Where did this come from? 
                - How does this fit with what we talked about last week? 
                - Oh, gosh, my mom does the same thing! It‚Äôs so annoying. 
            - All of these thoughts drive your attention away from Suzanne and make it difficult to listen deeply.
        - What is important is that you learn to notice your wandering thoughts, stop them, and then refocus your attention back to listening.
    - COLLECT DATA
        - The definition of data is information without any editorial or opinion.
        - Ascertaining data in your initial contact is extremely helpful over time. 
            - Think about your first impressions when meeting someone new. Suppose someone rubs you the wrong way; you‚Äôve already ‚Äúbanked‚Äù a judgment or opinion about them. 
            - In coaching especially, you want to take the data and remain completely neutral and detached; it‚Äôs just information to be stored.
                - Louise, a potential client, contacts you through email. She asks you to call her but doesn‚Äôt provide a phone number. The omission could be immediately stored as ‚Äúcareless,‚Äù ‚Äúoverwhelmed,‚Äù or ‚Äúanxious,‚Äù but it could have simply been an oversight. 
                    - That initial data should be simply information with no interpretation. But when Louise becomes a client, and another situation reminds you of this one, you can now go deeper into determining whether or not there is a pattern.
                - Richard, another potential client, contacts you by telephone. He introduces himself, and then before you have a chance to set up an appointment to speak with him, he is talking nonstop about his frustration at work. When he finally takes a breath, he starts asking all sorts of questions about coaching, how much it costs, etc. 
                    - Pay attention ‚Äî you‚Äôre already collecting important data. 
                    - Without getting hooked or making any judgment, once the relationship is underway you can address this when/if you hear him launching into details before you‚Äôve had a chance to ask what he wants to focus on for the session. 
                    - The first time you hear a client imply they have given up what they want for the sake of some else‚Äôs happiness, it‚Äôs data. But when you hear it again or there is evidence as they continue, it becomes __data in context that can be questioned__.
        - To maintain neutrality and foster transformation, it‚Äôs important to accept anything you learn about your client as simply data and recall it when it‚Äôs relevant.
        - EXPLORE OFFHAND COMMENTS
            - When your client makes an offhand comment, it shouldn‚Äôt be ignored. Question it, and if they say it‚Äôs not important, you can move on.
                - __People bring things up for a reason.__ Perhaps it‚Äôs just something they want to get off their chest or it could be something disturbing them, impacting the other topic they want to discuss.
                    - A client might say, ‚Äú__I‚Äôm having a really horrible time with my boss today,__ but I want to talk about my situation with my mother.‚Äù
                    - Ben, a VP, recently hired a coach. At the coaching session he said, ‚Äú__I don‚Äôt often ask for help.__ Here‚Äôs my situation. I‚Äôm having problems with one of my direct reports(a director). He doesn‚Äôt seem to understand instructions, and I‚Äôm finding that I have to follow up far more than is appropriate. I feel like I‚Äôm wasting so much valuable time making sure he completes things and does them correctly. At this point, my frustration level is boiling over. ‚Äù
                        - ‚ÄúI can hear how frustrating this must be with your director, and I also heard that you don‚Äôt often ask for help. What is that about?‚Äù 
                        - Ben responded, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be seen as a bad guy, and I‚Äôm not convinced that these are problems that need to be talked about.‚Äù 
                        - The coach then asked, ‚ÄúWhat might be the connection between not wanting to be seen as a bad guy and the situation with your director?‚Äù 
                        - Ben replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been told that I should keep the peace and not rock the boat.‚Äù
                        -  The conversation continued until Ben realized that this old message wasn‚Äôt serving him in all situations.
                - There‚Äôs a reason behind EVERYTHING a client shares in a coaching session.
        - MAINTAIN NEUTRALITY
            - Maintaining neutrality is perhaps the most difficult, but also one of the most important aspects, and it‚Äôs at the core of being a true professional.
            - Where is the line between authentic response and neutrality? 
                - The key is that whatever you share and whatever you question cannot have a ‚Äúcharge,‚Äù meaning it should have no emotion or opinion behind it. 
                    - See your sharing as simply a point to be made .
                        - For example, let‚Äôs say your client has been talking for quite a long time without pause. Instead of trying to make them see that their behavior is impacting you, or sharing your frustration (even unconsciously, such as in the emotion behind your words).
                        - You might say something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been listening to you for a long time now, and there is so much detail it‚Äôs really hard to stay focused. What do you think when you hear this?‚Äù
                    - This approach allows you to just share what you noticed and then give the choice of response to your client. It presents factual, objective information ‚Äî the data ‚Äî and allows them to decide where to go next.
            - How do you balance all the data you‚Äôve gathered about your client and still show up completely neutral?
                - Approach each coaching conversation as a fresh blank slate. 
                - If needed, you can go back to your databank and ask a question about something you observed over time or heard in a prior conversation, but only if that seems appropriate in the moment.
                    - For example, you might recall something stated in a prior conversation that seems to contradict what they‚Äôre saying now.
        - HOLD IN MIND TWO CRITICAL QUESTIONS 
            - 1) Why are they telling me this?
            - 2) What‚Äôs making this a problem for this person?
            - They are designed to help you be more curious about the person, sustain your focus, and really listen to understand what the underlying problem or ‚Äúfaulty thinking‚Äù is for your client. 
                - They will help you: 
                    - Focus on your client, not the story being shared 
                    - Recognize their emotional state while learning how they think and process information 
                    - Stay curious without being nosey about the details 
                    - Listen for what is not being said or what is underneath the words 
                    - Discover opportunities to ask questions that expand your client‚Äôs thinking
            - Jerry told an involved story about an argument between two of his coworkers during a staff meeting. He spoke about the intensity between the two of them and how each one would not back down on their point of view. He mentioned that when people tried to intervene, they ignored them and kept arguing.
                - Imagine if the coach was curious and wondered why Jerry was so invested in an argument that didn‚Äôt involve him? What was his point in going into so much detail? Thinking about ‚ÄúWhy is he telling me this?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is making this a problem for him?‚Äù could have led to questions to help Jerry explore the feelings, threats, or issues the argument created for him.
                - (Page 41). 
            - Patricia was hoping to go on a medical mission. In fact, it had been her long-term dream. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been counting on funds from a real estate deal to provide the financing. However, after all of the unexpected transaction fees, I received only about ten percent of what I had calculated. I‚Äôm so devastated, and I think I have to give up on my dream.‚Äù 
                - The coach said, ‚ÄúIt sounds like very deep disappointment and seems like a person who put all of their eggs in one basket. What comes up hearing that?‚Äù 
                - Patricia was silent for quite some time before saying, ‚ÄúYou are right and hearing that, I realize I didn‚Äôt plan well at all for something so important to me.‚Äù 
                - By the end of the conversation, Patricia felt empowered and altered her negative, limited trajectory, and planned to consult with her CPA and get creative accounting advice. (Soon after, she was able to cobble the funds together to fulfill her dream.)
                - If I had asked, ‚ÄúWhat will it mean for you to give up your dream?‚Äù it may have led to a downward spiral because I was buying into the story that Patricia messed up and can‚Äôt do what she really wants.
        - [[Language in Coaching]]
            - SPEAK CLIENT'S LANGUAGE
                - There are instances in which this can feel uncomfortable or strange. Even though that may be the case, it‚Äôs helpful for the client to use their vocabulary so __they don‚Äôt have to interpret what you‚Äôre saying__ or asking. 
                    - For example, if they use the word photograph and your word is picture, use their word. 
                    - If they use the expression ‚Äúout of pocket,‚Äù and your tendency is to substitute ‚Äúunavailable,‚Äù hold in your mind that you‚Äôre partnering with your client and that it is most effective to use their language even if it feels unnatural. 
                - This also helps your client feel heard and understood.
                - (Page 42). 
            - ELIMINATE JARGON ‚Äî IT ISN‚ÄôT UNIVERSAL
                - My overall rule of thumb is that I should never have to explain a word or expression to a client.
                - Coaching is supposed to sound like an everyday conversation with the exceptions of the 80/20 dialogue rule and the sharing of personal information.
                - For example
                    - ‚ÄúWhat do you have to lean in to?‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúWhat could be the opportunity?‚Äù
                    - ‚ÄúWho do you have to be?‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúWhat are some characteristics you would like to see in yourself?‚Äù
                    - ‚ÄúHow do you need to show up?‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúWhat do you need to do to prepare for the conversation?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat do you want people to notice about you?
                    - Using "belief" instead of "thoughts" or "ideas"
        - USE SILENCE REGULARLY
            - Silence is one of the most important tools in the coaching tool kit and the one least effectively used. 
                - It means not only being silent after you ask your question, but also staying silent after your client initially answers your question.
                - Let people process their thinking externally or internally, especially the internal one.
                    -  The client might just be taking a pause in their thinking and their wheels are still turning. A masterful coach should be able to decipher the fact that thinking is still going on despite hearing a preliminary response, and the client still needs even more thinking time. It‚Äôs better to err on the side of caution and stay quiet.
            - The only time it‚Äôs okay to ask another question right after your client responds is when you simply asked for fact information rather than stimulated the client to think, as with a question like, ‚ÄúWhat day did that happen?‚Äù
            - __Wait for the client to speak first no matter how difficult or uncomfortable it is to stay quiet.__
                - This is especially true after a question that makes your client think, because they may not be finished answering even though they have replied. Allow even more time in this case, even though they seem to be finished.
                    - An example: 
                        - Coach: What did that comment mean for you?
                        - Client: Hmm, I hadn‚Äôt thought about what it meant. [The Hmm or if there‚Äôs silence before responding is a clue to stay quiet even longer.] I guess it means that she‚Äôs waiting for me to address the issue first. [Allow silence again. ] Although as I think about it, I‚Äôm not sure that is my place. After all‚Ä¶.‚Äù
            - The last thing you want to do is disrupt your client‚Äôs thinking. It‚Äôs like having a fabulous dream and the alarm goes off; it immediately interrupts the dream and there is no going back. If your client thinks there‚Äôs too much silence, they‚Äôll let you know.
                - Silence is especially necessary after your client answers a provocative question. Just wait; they might be emotional or most likely still thinking even after giving an initial response. They may need a lot of space before being asked another question.
            - Question/answer/question/answer -> question/ silence/ answer/ silence... let clients fill in the space
            - Even after your client responds ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù after a thinking question, it‚Äôs still advisable to stay quiet and see if that simply means they don‚Äôt want to answer, are afraid to answer, or really need to think about the answer.
                - For example, a coach asks a client, ‚ÄúWhat are you afraid of?‚Äù and the client answers, ‚ÄúThat I will never be okay.‚Äù 
                - If the coach asks any question right after that, it creates a disconnect because the client‚Äôs response was particularly deep. 
                - If the client answers, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù it‚Äôs possible they don‚Äôt. But more often than not, they do know but may not want to say it aloud or they need time to think and digest their thoughts.
                    -  Your client may require an enormous amount of space to think and digest. 
                    - Any question would take them out of that space and bring them back into their mind. 
                    - In this instance it‚Äôs crucial to wait for the client to speak first.
        - BE EMPATHETIC
            - Client: I‚Äôm totally freaked out! I just found out that my husband cheated on me and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do. I don‚Äôt know if I should tell my children what‚Äôs going on, and I don‚Äôt know if this means I‚Äôm going to get divorced! 
                - Then I heard the coach parrot: I hear that you‚Äôre really upset that you just found out that your husband is cheating on you and you‚Äôre not sure if you should tell the children and you‚Äôre not sure what this is going to mean for you. Did I get that right?
                - In the prior example, the client provided the emotion: freaked out, and she shared ways she feels uncertain about her future. An appropriate empathy statement could be, ‚ÄúI get how all of this is freaking you out and that it‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty to deal with all at once.‚Äù
            - Your voice, tone, and pace matter . Especially when emotion is evident, it‚Äôs crucial to let the client know that you empathize and understand the reason for the emotion by ‚Äúnormalizing‚Äù their feelings.
                - To empathize, identify one or two primary emotions and reflect that information. 
            - Imagine the scenario above if the coach went directly to, ‚ÄúWhat outcome do you want from this conversation?‚Äù
                - This is an example of a ‚Äúnaked,‚Äù nonresponsive question that is completely inappropriate. 
                - It not only ignores what the client said and the feeling behind her words, but also asks her to define an outcome while she‚Äôs in an emotional state.
                - A masterful empathic response might be: ‚ÄúIt sounds as though you‚Äôve been blindsided and are understandably upset. What would be helpful in our conversation?‚Äù
                - (Page 45). 
            - (Page 45). 
            - The empathy demonstrates that you understand and when you ask the follow-up question, it is an invitation for them to choose what they want.
                - Instead of ‚Äúfixing‚Äù the client or going into problem-solving, consider that the client may not want anything other than 
                    - an opportunity to vent and will feel as though they have permission to do so 
        - CREATE A SAFE AND TRUSTING SPACE
            - Clients reveal more information when they feel a sense of trust and safety. If they have any doubt or hesitation, they will likely hold back. It is the role of the coach to create a safe space and a trusting environment.
            - To accomplish this safe and trusting environment, keep in mind that the relationship is more important than the results. 
                - Yes, results are important, but working with human beings with complex thoughts, feelings, and experiences has to be uppermost in our minds. 
                - With a focus on the relationship and letting go of a strong need for results, deeper trust is created, more can be revealed, and clients go far beyond their initial intention.
            - [[Coaching examples]]
                - Erica initially came for coaching because she was unhappy in her job. During our coaching engagement, not only did she change jobs twice, she eventually opened up her own studio. She went from dating to marriage to starting a family. The relationship deepened over a period of several years and went far beyond her initial reason for coaching. 
                - Melissa came to the call sounding quite upset and immediately shared that she was unexpectedly pregnant. She said she hadn‚Äôt told her husband or parents yet but had to tell someone. All I did was stay present and let her know I was there. She didn‚Äôt come for any result as much as wanting to process and be heard. Without many words from me, she said she felt my empathy and connection. Several months later, she shared that because of our coaching relationship, she knew she could trust me to hold the space for her .
            - Sometimes, coaching is only about the relationship and respecting the client‚Äôs humanity.
        - PLAY DUMB TO BE SMART
            - If you approach coaching as though you‚Äôre the expert and you know what‚Äôs best for your client, not only are you not being a coach, but you‚Äôre also dismissing your client‚Äôs wisdom. 
                - In fact, the more you can demonstrate curiosity and your desire to understand who your client is, the better your coaching will be.
            - It is imperative to be willing to be wrong about any attitude or belief. Phrases such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little confused‚Äù or ‚ÄúI may be wrong, but it seems as though‚Ä¶‚Äù not only invite your client to share better information but also demonstrate that you are the outside, objective listener that you should be. 
                - If you put something out there and you‚Äôre wrong, so what? 
                - As long as you get new data, that‚Äôs what is important. 
                - Coaching is not about being right or wrong; it‚Äôs about getting to the truth for your client. 
                - In fact, if you say or guess incorrectly when sharing something, they‚Äôre happy to share the accurate information. It can actually spur them to share more.
        - AFFIRM VERSUS ACKNOWLEDGE
            - To properly acknowledge our client, providing some context is helpful.
                - Acknowledging: ‚ÄúThanks for sharing that information.‚Äù 
                - Affirming: ‚ÄúThanks for sharing that information because it helps me better understand your mindset.‚Äù 
                - The distinction is that, when affirming, we are being specific and providing context .
                - 
            - [[Coaching examples]]
                - Josh, a client who was dating a lot, told me a story about a woman who called about going out again, and I noticed a change in how he responded. 
                    - I said, ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm really hearing is that the way you handled this particular conversation is so different from how you would‚Äôve handled it six months ago. It‚Äôs just showing how much progress you‚Äôve made and how far you‚Äôve come. What do you think about that?‚Äù 
                    - Josh replied, ‚ÄúWow, this is getting easier for me. I didn‚Äôt realize I was improving. That‚Äôs so cool.‚Äù He was appreciative of my noting that he had made progress.
        - DISTINGUISH: TELLING VERSUS DISCOVERING
            - When is it appropriate to tell your client something you know versus letting them figure it out for themselves? 
                - When emotion is involved, it‚Äôs best for your client to discover. When they discover the answer for themselves, it has more meaning, more value, and leads to a permanent change. And if the discovery is about them and who they are, only they know the answer.
                - When it‚Äôs a fact, a greater truth, or a direct observation, tell it. 
                    - By ‚Äúa greater truth‚Äù I mean something universally accepted as true by most people but not a fact. 
                    - In these situations, don‚Äôt frustrate your client by asking them questions to force a discovery. Instead, say what you know and question how they receive it by asking something like ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù
                    - Here are some examples of greater truths: 
                        - It‚Äôs harder to find a job during an economic downturn. 
                        - Women talk with friends to create bonds. 
                        - Men identify strongly with their jobs/careers/work. 
                        - Some people are content with the status quo and have no interest in changing. 
                        - People have a tendency to confuse selfish with self-care.
