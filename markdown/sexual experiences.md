- sex is about having a sexual experiences and enjoy it together, not about satisfy our urges or desires to release our inner disturbances of our body
- Principles for making sexual experiences
    - Slow and feel the process, rather than rush through the process
    - Undress slowly, one by one - experience different things in the process
    - learn to see and appreciate the beauty and holiness of women body by everything - not just the boobs, pussy, and face
    - care about how our action impact our partner to share the experiences together
    - handle our inner disturbances and learn to release them, so that they won't able to control us
- For specific
    - boobs - using hands or mouths with varieties of actions to simulate it slowly
    - pussy - using hands or mouths - play when still not undress - feel the clothes, care for how partner react when undress slowly - make them surprise by focus on other part instead of the pussy rightaway
