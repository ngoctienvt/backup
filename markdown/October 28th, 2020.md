- I have a dream about [[Nguyễn Diễm Kiều]]. I felt that I still have a desire with her and not able to let it go completely yet. She is cute, kind and gentle. She makes me feel peace, I can be myself around her and I want to take care of her. 
- My physical body feel so tired in the morning, I still haven't able to resolve this yet. It feels cold inside, and make me feel hurt. [[physical body]]
- It seems like there are multiple goals that I want to achieve, and I want to apply all of them based on one approach. [[living from the place of surrender]]
    - Some of my current goals are
        - living from the place of surrender to soul evolution
        - building a personal knowledge management system to acquire wisdom
        - developing coaching skills, creating training courses,...
    - These goals are based only two things
        - One is do the most important sustainable responsibility - soul evolution
        - Second is learning to serve the reality as best as possible
    - So instead of focusing too many goals as one.
        - I will build a basic function for my soul evolution process first. And my approach to do this task is through an progressive approach that focus on cleaning what now, day by day, bit by bit, while still experience and live at the same time. 
            - The reason is it not a one time task, but rather a task that happens over a life time, and my ability to execute this task also develop through the period.
- [[coaching reflection]] Today coaching, I noticed that I still have a long journey to truly coach from the place of surrender. I still feel that I'm trying too much and not listen deep enough. I will focus fully on this after I complete my [[journaling training]]. I will still work on it bit by bit on that period of time.

- I noticed that I need to establish a new way of looking life. It's not that there is time I work, other time I don't work. The fact is I always do something, this is a [[continuous process]] with no stop at all. I just transition from one work to another work, from an intentional work to unconscious work. Once I still not aware and work fully on my unconscious work, I still will be trying non-stop to overcome that unconscious instead of working on it to direct myself fully to the flow that I want to live with. [[habit-formed will]] [[seeing the truth of the world]]
    - The whole point is I need to show up on the work first. If I go on the right direction half-way, and the rest I still get lost and further my goal, then I will never able to reach my goal, or it will take a really long time. 
    - When I don't show up to work inside myself, I lost myself in it.
- [[contextual usages]]
    - right thing
    - right attitude
    - right way
    - right place
    - right time
- When I reading the talk about the state of boardgame, I feel that people still focus on the problem and try to fix that problem, instead of focusing on what they truly want, and work their way through that with creativity, provoking ideas, expanding self-development. [[end goals]] 
- [[development management]] is the term that I start to see the system that I want to build for myself, so that it will nurture my grow naturally and just keep rolling.
- It felt so satisfied that I noticed when after certain period of times, especially near what I used to with. My brain will start to tell me that it’s my limitation, that I should take a rest, that it’s okay to stop here. The whole point is I’m easy to be deceived by this thoughts that based on my past experiences, instead of I’m the one who check whether I want to stop or not, so that I could make my [[conscious choice]]. [[naive]] [[inner thoughts]] [[give up thoughts]]
- My highest [[priority]] now is being able to enjoy the moment, enjoy doing nothing instead of always follow the inner thougths, and inner urge. I need to be comfortable to [[centering on the seat of awareness]] so that I could develop my next stage of development is [[unattachment centering]].
- For coaching, instead of trying to put the truth to them, I need to learn to stand back, let go of my [[personal needs]]. Then learn to help them to see the truth and their own perception by themselves through various skills like
    - impersonal reflection
    - metaphor
    - painting contrast
    - exploring the perception
- [[abundance appreciation]] 
    - In order to develop a mindset to set myself above my ego-consciousness, it is good to direct myself to [[truth compass]]
        - reflect the bad that we’re done for others and let go the good that we’re done for others 
        - honor the good that others have done for us and embrace the bad that others have done for us.
- [[validation]]
    - Not giving solutions but show understanding
    - Not taking the spot out of them to us
    - Giving full attention and presence
    - Ask questions for deeper understanding and connection
    - Validate them
