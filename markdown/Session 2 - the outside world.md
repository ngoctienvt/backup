- ### Introduction
    - As we enter Session Two,** you are now aware that you are in there.** You are not your thoughts, your emotions, or the reflection you see in the mirror—you are the one who is looking. We have called this your seat of awareness.
    - From this seat of awareness, **you look out** into the world, watch your thoughts, and feel your emotions. **These are all objects of consciousness, **but **where did they come from?** Perhaps** if you understood this better,** you would be **more comfortable accepting them as they are.** 
    - **Acceptance is a major step in surrender.** In this session, we will explore some very fundamental questions: 
        - What is the outside world, 
        - where did it come from, 
        - and what is your actual relationship to it?
- ### Lessons
    - Surrender is about let go of falsehood to comeback to the absolute truth. 
        - It's not about the self seeking self, it's about the self letting go of what's not true.
        - Surrender is releasing the ignorance
    - Shock-statement:
        - Do you know that the moment in front of you have nothing to do with you? 
            - It belongs to itself. You don't make it come, or make it go.
            - The moment is impersonal.
        - Proving
            - Is the [[moment]] in front of me is the only moment in the universe? 
                - No, there are moments happen everywhere.
                - Every moments out there has nothing to do with you, why the moment in front you have something to do with you?
                    - This moment is the same as any moment in the creation
                    - It's not the moments are the twin, but your relationship with the moments are the same.
    - In order to live the truth, we need to learn to honor the truth that "I haven't been living the truth. I have been living the ignorance."
        - Ignorance is ignoring something.
        - We have been personalize something that's not personal.
    - Question "Where does the moment in front of me coming from?"
        - Big Bang
        - 4 fundamental forces
            - Electromagnetic force
            - Gravity
            - Weak nuclear force
                - the force that causes decay slowly
            - Strong nuclear force
                - the force that strong enough to offset the repulsion of electromagnetic force to hold the nuclear to each other
        - The moment in front of us are holy and special things that created by 4 fundamental forces and took 13.8 billion years to get here
            - Life and the moment in front of us came from the stars
        - Science helped us to know where life comes from, but we still don't know where consciousness (us) comes from and what's happening before the Big Bang.
            - To know about us, it's not about studying the outside, it's about exploring inside.
        - Stars, forces, molecules are elements of how creation taking place. Just like the paint brush of painter.
    - Does the creation process have anything to do with you?
        - By understanding the creation process, we can start to let go a part inside of us that have been not living the truth.
    - The relationship between us and the moment in front of us are 
        - we are given a unique show that took 13.8 billion years to create
        - you think you have the reason to complain about it, but it's the trick of the mind
        - Science support to take away the right to make the moment in front of us personal.
            - The universe is keep moving from time-space
            - Our consciousness is just a flashlight that happens to shine into the moment at that time.
        - The moment is not just happen in front of us, it's also asking us to participate with the dance that taking place.
            - It's not about we like or not like it
    - Jhana yoga is the yoga of wisdom
        - Put inside our head something that's others than like and dislike
        - Use our mind for truth
        - Use our mind for contemplate higher things than personal things
    - Our job is transcending the personal aspect, because it's not personal.
        - Honor and respect the moments in front of us
- ### Summary
    - In Session One, you became aware that you are in there. It should be easy to see this, but typically **we focus on what is happening in there**—**instead of the fact that we are actually in there.** You are not your thoughts, your emotions, or the reflection you see in the mirror—you are the one who is looking.
    - **But what exactly is it that you are experiencing in there?**
    - There is always a moment unfolding in front of you. As we learned in this session, **the moment in front of you has nothing to do with you;** it just **happens to be where you are looking at that moment in time.** The moment in front of you has been in the making for **13.8 billion years and has now arrived** on your doorstep.** The moment does not belong to you, and it is not personal.** The moment in front of you s**imply asked you to participate in the dance that is taking place;** it did **not ask you to like it or dislike it.**
    - **Where did the moment in front of you come from?** Our scientists have studied in great detail where the universe and every atom within it came from. It is truly remarkable! We learn that **the present moment is the perfect result of all prior events in creation.** Since every event that takes place is the result of every single thing that ever happened, you get to experience the miracle of creation every single moment of your life. **When you wake up to the miracle of the moment, you begin to perceive every moment as special and holy.**
    - Whether you are on a conference call at work, studying for an exam in the school library, or cleaning your kitchen floor at home, **the moment in front of you is constantly asking you to participate in the dance of life.** The moment asked you to call that person on the phone, engage with the study materials, and pick up the mop. 
    - [[inner clarity]] is about **waking up to both the reality and the miracle of the moment.** 
        - It is** realizing the moment in front of you would exist with or without you,** 
        - and **at the same time, understanding that engaging with the moment allows you to step into the flow of the universe.**
- ### Reflecting questions
    - Are you able to recognize the holiness of the moment in front of you? Please describe a moment you recently experienced that you now see as holy, whereas before you might have overlooked it. For example: watching it rain, waking up in the morning, eating an apple, overhearing your neighbors argue in the middle of the night, meeting with someone at work about a project, or waiting at the bus stop with strangers.
    - Next time you catch yourself taking the moment in front of you personally, are you willing to step back and put it in perspective? For example, at work, your boss chooses someone else’s idea instead of yours. Explain how meaningful this looks in relation to the planet Earth spinning through empty space.
    - A lot was covered in this session. What was your biggest takeaway?
