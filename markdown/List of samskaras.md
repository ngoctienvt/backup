        - I have a bit [[attachment with money]] when I need to pay
for things that I don't pay usually, especially if it subscribes for a long
time. The reason is I'm not sure that will I really use it and fear that I
won't able to sustain it for long term. [[living in the future]]
        - Instead of that, I could just simply define what I really
need right now, and is it serve it? Not what I think I could have, but what I
will actually use. [[abundance appreciation]]
        - I'm spending my effort to create a mind-training course with
progressive approach.
        - Tiago Forte posts really stimulate me the deep knowledge
that it will take a long time for me to develop on my own.
        - 10$ subscribe is worth it as a content of a book. But now is
many articles instead.
        - I also can use Evernote if I want to store articles that I
haven't able to digest on the 1 month period, and don't need to pay next.
        - I will feel much freer if I focus on what it will really
serve me instead of the fear that comes from comparison and greedy by my ego.
