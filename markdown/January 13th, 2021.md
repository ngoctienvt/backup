- In this new stage of life, I want to have a clear picture about [[üß≠Productivity System MOC]]
    - what I need to develop, 
    - what's my current stage (my styles, strengths, tendencies),
    - what I'm not comfortable with but it's important to have
    - how I will focus on my attention and how I will develop myself - the learning journey
        - the focus will be on serving the world, not about me expressing my ego
    -  It's all about how I could let go my restlessness and my stressfulness or trying too much, so that I could just relax, do things slowly but still complete them in an effective way
        - I need to have a room that in that room, I can casually complete what I need to do without worry too much. 
        - There will be different stages of my growth, but whether what stages, I can always know what I need to focus on and have the clear how to complete it
    - It's all about how I will manage the gap - the reality and the intention, because how I manage the gap now is based on my tendencies and maximize it, but it's not truly how things work [[gap management]]
- My today focus
    - Clarify the above picture
    - Clarify my learning styles
    - Think how I will want to design the activity that center on students
        - My tendency is mostly about how I can think of, but it has no direction to navigate. Now it's my time to learn to use principles or boundaries to navigate my focus on.
- [[Organization of knowledge]] should be a part of some end purposes, so that the knowledge is organized in a way that serve these purposes.
    - For instance, if my purpose is to coach effectively, then my coaching knowledge need to be organize in a way that I can access them in a systematic way somehow so that I could coach better in the coaching session
    - If my purpose is to write inspiring blog posts, then my notes need to be serve me to create these blog posts easily.
    - The end point of learning is to have some kind of structure or [[framework]], so that when you receive certain inputs, you‚Äôre able to produce certain outputs.
        - The right way to take notes, then depends on two factors: 
            - the output that you want to create
            - your ability to work on that structure during the first pass.

- I noticed that the way we use our words determine that something is evidently exist without notice that it maybe comes from our mind instead. [[impersonal language]]
    - Such of these words are failures, risks, problems, win, lose,... My next stage of life will need to rearrange my whole way of seeing the truth of the world rather than the madeup of my mind and the society.

- [[metacognitive]]
    - 1) Knowledge of person variables refers to general knowledge about how human beings learn and process information, as well as individual knowledge of one's own learning processes. 
    - 2) Task variables include knowledge about the nature of the task and what it will require of the individual.
    -  3) knowledge about strategy variables include knowledge about ways to improve learning as well as conditional knowledge about when and where it is appropriate to use such strategies.
    - For example
        - When individuals engaged in the process of learning by reflective monitoring of the learning process they are going through, they can begin to understand important aspects of learning: 
            - how they move through each stage of the learning cycle, 
            - the way their unique learning style fits with how they are being taught,
            - and the learning demands of what is being taught. 
        - This comparison results in strategies for action that can be applied in their ongoing learning process.
- Today I feel that I still have many inner disturbances and my thoughts or process of my thinking is still pretty complicated and overload. 
- I notice that my way of thinking tend to mix up and have no clear framework to direct but try to do everything at the same time. This lead to it become unneccessary complicated and not context dependent, but too much generalize. [[üå±My way of thinking]]
    -  I need to reframe my thinking that context mastery is far more important than having concepts. My way of thinking need to be output-driven rather than concept-driven.
    - Concepts are just the materials that need to extract properly base on the output that I need to create or problems that I need to handle.
