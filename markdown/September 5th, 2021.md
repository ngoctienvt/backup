    - Highlights:
        - It has been a week long of disturbances and distractions.
            - I still have not achieve a perpetual peace state of being. I still be disturbed by my staff, and I'm learning to let go the disturbances.
            - I still be distracted by game, books, and feel a loss of energy. I'm still learning to remain conscious and maintain the inner flow of energy into an inner endless loop even when I'm interacting with life.
            - I still feel some pressures when hearing the order of other people like my parents. I'm learning to not be influence and see it as it is, so that I will have a proper respond to it.
        - I notice that my physical health is not in a good shape, and I will need to take care of it more.
