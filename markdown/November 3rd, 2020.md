- It felt so good to feel moving forward and become better each day. Let go any thoughts, attachments, accept life as it is so that I could enjoy the life itself without any [[personal standards]] or [[personal agenda]]. 
- Why I want to support [[Vũ Khôi Nguyên]]?
    - The reason is I saw that he is enthusiastic, have a willingness to overcome challenges and he's just lacking person who support him to do the inner work.
    - I feel that I want to support people who already have the desire, the willingness, only lack the ability to work on the right thing. [[target clients]]
    - Is there any my [[personal agenda]] here? Not much I think. Maybe a few expectations for compensation if it will succeed, or a little bit feeling good when able to support a person.
- Each intention most of the time will have a certain amount of [[personal needs]]. To truly raise the moment and support them develop on their own perfect way, it's important to let go all of these personal needs, so that there will be nothing that I will do for my [[lower-self]], and only to [[serving the demand of reality]] instead.
- It seems like to me to process external data, there will be some tasks like this [[workflow]]
    - Collecting raw-data
    - Highlighting and tagging raw-data
    - Write key take-aways
    - Write summarization
- [[coaching reflection]] I felt that I'm still quite restless and not fully relax and let things happen. I still have a little bit of try to prove the effectiveness of coaching, instead of fully surrender myself to the moment and the person in front of me.
- My [[current work]] will focus on
    - Build my [[workflow]] with the support of [[journaling]], [[integration activity]], [[learning]] or experiencing.
        - I want my workflow will makes me [[natural progression]] and no need to things too much. Create a [[flow]] that can easily adapt to anything, any situation, or any context.
        - [[focus on what matters]] instead of based on my samskaras
        - The main method will be [[integration activity]], then [[journaling]], then [[learning]] or testing to complete the picture gradually.
- After taking a [[surrender walk]], I can truly zoom-out to see that life always happens by itself, not depend and own by anyone, any individual or creature. 

In daily life, we tend to zoom-in so much so that all we can know is what's in front of us, and the urge that drives us to act in certain ways so that we feel much better inside. This zoom-in makes us see life in the too small picture and thought that's life.
- My [[current work]] for my spiritual path is leaning away from the disturbance and have a zoom-out view consistently, so that I will not pull away from my [[seat of consciousness]] and able to accept and honour the reality without taking it personally. 
    - I'm like a guest that has a chance to experience the unfolding movies of life. And I'm not just a passive guest, but can be an active guest to contribute to the movies as well. [[witness consciousness]]
        - My main job is to learn to not ruin the show by my incapable of enjoy the movies by itself first.
