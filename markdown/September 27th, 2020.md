- Today, I felt new things inside me start to emerge and change my way of operation in a behavior way that shifting myself to focus more on more. The shift from external to internal become much easier and natural.
- My [[physical body]] also started to become more and more need to take care a little bit when I started to free myself out of what tethered me.
- Next week my focus will be:
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Working with samskaras
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Working with [[natural progression]] concept
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Working with the way I want to support the evolution process of other souls with an [[unattachment]] attitude.
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Working with [[generated language]]
- I just had a [[fear]] about the destruction of my ipad.
- I noticed that I want to improve my [[voice]] and in order to do this effectively, I want to able to listen to my [[true voice]]. 
    - The method that I find currently is using two thick boards to cover my ears. I will try it and then find how I can improve this because I feel that I need to use physical energy to do it. [[way to hear self-voice]]
    - The reason I want to improve my voice is because I want to learn to use my physical body in a [[helpful manner]] so that I can bring more positive experience and create positive impact to other souls. [[impactful being]]
- I also noticed that I used to use [[bottom-up approach]] and because of this, I'm not comfortable or effectively use my [[powerful questions]] in a focused way when I need to use [[top-down boundary]] to support clients get their mind to focus in their specific concern. I want to learn to use [[top-down boundary]].
- I also feel the disturbance when hearing Ha complain about the door and the bell. I feel guilty and like I am the one needs to responsible for it and it makes me feel that's my [[fault]]. I'm unconsciously attaching myself to it and make it personal for me, instead of free myself and just learn from the experience. [[emotions]] [[spiritual growth]]
- I noticed that I still have a lot of attachments to the tools that make me feel good like iPad, television, house, physical things that I need to pay a lot of money to have. [[unattachment]] [[attachment]] [[possession]] [[money]] 
- When watching GAGA, I realized that I have a [[moment]] that the song that I heard went directly to myself and get past the inner world that I built inside. This experience makes me really feel that the current moment has gone all the way in because there is a little hole for it leaks in before it got block by the things that I hold inside and stimulate them instead.
