- Why? The main meaning of [[condensing process]] is to help you achieve [[deeper understanding]] about the topics, concepts, so you can merge your scattering thoughts to a pearl of wisdom. 
    - This process is like a process of [[pressure makes diamonds]], and these diamonds are the materials for [[condensing process]] or using into [[real life application]]. 
- [[ideal process]]
    - Flow
    - Feel intuitive and natural
    - Require less or no effort
- The ideal condense thought process:
    - collecting meaningful data (summerize, key take-aways, new awareness, new understanding...)
    - The old dumping thoughts are still present, so actually copy makes it easier. I only need to use [[Block Reference]] for the one that got condensed already, so I can upgrade it over time.
- How to organize information?
    - The information will be organized in a way that can edit or add-on later, or support [[condensing process]] or support the next [[condensing process]].
    - The concept will be isolated by itself or could be live in a bigger concept to make it wholer, but understanding will be centered around the idea of the topic concept.
- The condensing process:
    - Same as [[accumulate thought process]], but focus more on concepts, definitions, key ideas, usages,... Review and reread your related thoughts to get keywords or summarize of what you focus on in the [[accumulate thought process]].
    - Refined and repackage the thoughts into simple concepts, definitions, and remove unnecessary words. Changed from free-writing to concept-writing.
    - Repeat this process for any things that you want to deep dive to produce more and more little diamonds.
