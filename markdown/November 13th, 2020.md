    - For [[process]] [[terminology]], I could use the word
        - cycle to refer the whole of something
        - phase for major stages 
        - stage for sub-phases
        - For example:
            -  Personal Knowledge Development cycle
                - Capturing phase
                - Shaping phase
                - Consolidating and nurturing phase
                - Creating phase
                - Re-organizing phase
    - Today has been an effective day, I clarified my work a lot, and seem like there will be new things for me to learn a new workshop tomorrow, I'm exciting about it. I also feel that the snowball is rolling. I want to share my joy with [[Nguyễn Mỹ Linh]] anh I also want to hear how's she doing, any if I can do something to help her with.
    - It's a little bit overwhelming though, because there are many things that accumulated and many new things that I want to learn. But I can truly feel that I'm doing better. I'm living. I'm alive. Not as the way before, but truly alive.
- [[Clarifying]]
    - My flow of work and flow of living [[workflow]]
        - Somehow I see that's it will be more about the action that will I do rather than the object or the topic that I'm working on.
        - There are some actions that I current aware of is
            - Centering to cleaning my inner stress and samskaras, as well as enjoy the moments
            - Writing to clarify thoughts process, thinking effectively, identify unanswered questions, consolidating 
            - Consuming through reading books or articles, watching Youtube videos or courses, listening to podcasts or audiobooks for learning new things
            -  Entertaining for relaxing
        - I will want to start my day with [[workflow]]
            - centering through meditation activities, so that I could stay on being myself
            - writing morning page for narrowing today focus
            - work on main tasks like thinking, consolidating, clarifying, so I could serve the reality
            - doing project or scheduled tasks like translating, coaching, training, also for serving the reality
            - entertaining when near lunchtime, sleeping and meditation sometimes in between the day, for energy and willpower recharge

        - evergreen notes, atomic concepts,
            - this one I'm not really clear yet. This is my clarifying stage, and now I need to clarify what I need to clarify. After collecting and shaping a bunch of notes, I will start to emerge the higher-order concepts that I could spend time to spend my time thinking on. 
            - Then I will start to see the components that it's holding like
                - Personal Knowledge Development system will have 
                    - personal knowledge development cycle, 
                    - the approach to develop the knowledge, 
                    - the procedure to nurture the knowledge, 
                    - the support system and tools needed
            - Now what is the roles of atomic concepts, and evergreen notes here?
                - personal knowledge development cycle will be the concept that I need to develop 
                - while I could develop some evergreen notes for explaining about this sytem like
                    - Why we need personal knowledge development cycle?
                    - How to develop your own?
                    - These evergreen notes is more about for other person instead of myself. 
                - So actually atomic concepts more about my own internalizing, while evergreen notes is developing for further unstanding and more about externalizing
- goal, approach, principle, method, execution, purpose, stage versus action... This one for tomorrow [[November 14th, 2020]]
