- [[Journaling]]
    - I'm thinking that today I will be focus on 
        - clarify the relationship between 
    - For [[process]] [[terminology]], I could use the word
        - cycle to refer the whole of something
        - phase for major stages 
        - stage for sub-phases
        - For example:
            -  Personal Knowledge Development cycle
                - Capturing phase
                - Shaping phase
                - Consolidating and nurturing phase
                - Creating phase
                - Re-organizing phase
- [[Clarifying]]
    - My flow of work and flow of living [[workflow]]
        - Somehow I see that's it will be more about the action that will I do rather than the object or the topic that I'm working on.
        - There are some actions that I current aware of is
            - Centering to cleaning my inner stress and samskaras, as well as enjoy the moments
            - Writing to clarify thoughts process, thinking effectively, identify unanswered questions, consolidating 
            - Consuming through reading books or articles, watching Youtube videos or courses, listening to podcasts or audiobooks for learning new things
            -  Entertaining for relaxing
        - I will want to start my day with [[workflow]]
            - centering through meditation activities, so that I could stay on being myself
            - writing morning page for narrowing today focus
            - work on main tasks like thinking, consolidating, clarifying, so I could serve the reality
            - doing project or scheduled tasks like translating, coaching, training, also for serving the reality
            - entertaining when near lunchtime, sleeping and meditation sometimes in between the day, for energy and willpower recharge

    - The MOC stage of personal knowledge management system
        - evergreen notes, atomic concepts,
            - this one I'm not really clear yet. This is my clarifying stage, and now I need to clarify what I need to clarify. After collecting and shaping a bunch of notes, I will start to emerge the higher-order concepts that I could spend time to spend my time thinking on. 
            - Then I will start to see the components that it's holding like
                - Personal Knowledge Development system will have 
                    - personal knowledge development cycle, 
                    - the approach to develop the knowledge, 
                    - the procedure to nurture the knowledge, 
                    - the support system and tools needed
            - Now what is the roles of atomic concepts, and evergreen notes here?
                - personal knowledge development cycle will be the concept that I need to develop 
                - while I could develop some evergreen notes for explaining about this sytem like
                    - Why we need personal knowledge development cycle?
                    - How to develop your own?
                    - These evergreen notes is more about for other person instead of myself. 
                - So actually atomic concepts more about my own internalizing, while evergreen notes is developing for further unstanding and more about externalizing
            - There will be certain principles for me to develop the notes so that it will serve me best.
                - I think Map of contents just make me think about navigating, it's fine though, because I will develop many atomic concepts and evergreen notes inside here.
                - However, beside of MOC, I will need to have some ways to call these high-order development centralized notes. It's like the notes that contain the evergreen notes. Temporary I could it as central notes.
                - I will need to develop my own terminology for type of notes, so I could easy to visualize. [[terminology]] [[PKDS - Personal Knowledge Development System terminology]]
                    - I still have some not clear with terminology about evergreen notes. Before I view evergreen notes as long-writing notes, while actually it is more about the notes that will be develop over time, so actually every note on my developing phase are evergreen notes.
                    - Now there will be some type of [[evergreen notes]] here
                        - One will be for my own understanding - concept notes, process notes, 
                        - Second is about further understanding and serving reality through teaching to other people.
                    - 
    - goal, approach, principle, method, execution, purpose, stage versus action...
        - zoom-out and zoom-in point of view
