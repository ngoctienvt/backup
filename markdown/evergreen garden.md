- digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.
- Another characteristic is the navigation:
    - a digital garden uses bi-directional linking—or at least lots of internal links—to connect notes together. Such interconnection creates a trail of ideas that readers can follow.
- **Seeds.** Seed your garden with quality content and cultivate your curiosity. Plant seeds in your mind garden by taking smart personal notes ([taking raw notes is useless](https://www.mentalnodes.com/taking-raw-notes-is-useless)). These don't need to be written in a publishable form.
- **Trees.** Grow your knowledge by forming new branches and connecting the dots. Write short structured notes articulating specific ideas and publish them in your digital garden. One note in your digital garden = one idea. (what you're currently reading is such a note) [Do not keep orphan notes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/do-not-keep-orphan-notes). [Thread your thoughts.](https://www.mentalnodes.com/threaded-thinking-instead-of-linear-thinking)
- **Fruits.** Produce [new work](https://www.mentalnodes.com/on-the-newness-of-ideas). These are more substantial—essays, videos, maybe a book at some point. The kind of work researchers and creatives may hope will help them [live beyond their expiration date](https://www.mentalnodes.com/living-beyond-your-expiration-date).
