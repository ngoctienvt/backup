- Last night, I have a dream that I got [[angry]] and released my angry into other people. And I felt that I'm doing the right thing, and this type of thinking helped me to release my anger temporarily. However, it didn't help me to work on the root that why I felt angry in the first place. [[spiritual growth]]
    - The thinking that made me felt right about releasing anger into other people is they didn't treat me well when things I didn't like or I didn't able to handle yet happen to me. At that moment, I felt the need to make myself better because I felt disturbed inside, so releasing anger helped me to feel better. But this is not a long-term solution, the root cause is I can't handle the event that happened to me and I count on other people to help me handle it unconsciously. [[root cause]]

- In [[coaching]], coach turn off [[condensing process]] of their mind and let the clients in charge this process in their own inner universe. This means that the clients will provoke their thinking, and active their own mind to generate higher thinking level. This process also requires clients face what's the [[underlying concern]] or the [[root cause]] of their goals instead of focus on the [[solution]] or [[method]] to achieve their goals.
    - By turn off their own mind, coach can connect with their source and operate from that level to fully [[embrace]] the whole being of client. This will be the main materials for a [[coach]] to generate their own inner message which is compatible with clients.
    - So what coach bring to the session is not their own mind, but their own source so they can always work on a higher [[level of thinking]] instead of limited by their current mind.
- First three days using [[Roam Research]] [[graph overview]]
    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FNgoctien%2F9icyWb7UmP.png?alt=media&token=6bcf54f8-5692-4c7a-a1dc-929bd284cec5)
- Instead of focusing on teaching how to do the things right, my [[training method]] will base on the [[thinking process]] behind it. This is extremely helpful because it didn't [[limit]] the students to my temporary method, but helps them to develop their mind so they can generate their way of working. [[sustainable development]]
- [[coaching reflection]] today I feel I can presence and see things much clearer than before. Because I can observe what is really happening in other mind and trust them to process their own thinking and just be there to support them generate new [[level of thinking]].
- I noticed that I want to write an article about how [[Roam Research]] helped me to support the brain work in a much more effective way. The reason I want to write this article is to condense my thinking about [[the way our brain operates]] and how we live unnaturally with life.
    - Our [[mind]] operates like a [[universe]].
        - There is no limitation of how high it could go or how detail level it could become. [[unlimited]]
        - There is no hierarchy in the universe. Everything is a central node with different meanings. [[inter-related]]
        -  There is a star that dies off over time and becomes the material for the evolution of other advanced stars. [[material]] [[progression]] 
    - 
- The ability to recognize [[emergence]] is good, but the ability to [[design for emergence]] or [[condition for emergence]] is super important and impactful. [[mind-training]] [[training method]]
    - In emergence, we shift from [[linear thinking]] or [[circular thinking]] to [[connection thinking]] or [[emergence recognization]]. Things never happen linear, they are all [[inter-related]]. 
    - [[Roam Research]] design helped us to maintain ourselves in [[intellectual mind]] and rise above [[personal mind]].
    - When we learnt from other people knowledge, the knowledge is like a new star that suddenly appear inside our universe with no or very little connection with our universe. And in order to understand this new star and make connection with it, we will need to put our effort into that, and this is why [[coaching]] or [[self-generative]] is so powerful, because you built your own stars so you will familiar with it, even though it’s just [[emergence]]
- I still feel [[anxious]] and [[worry]] about the problem that appears in my life, like wifi problem. I also [[worry]] about any events that will happen in the future, because I don't know what I feel at that moment. I worry that I will drop myself to a lower level of energy, and this makes me feel stressful. I want to change my attitude that instead of worry about what will happen, I will learn to handle any things happen with a [[receiving attitude]] and willing to let things happen and trust the process.

- I feel that I accumulate a lot of thoughts and they even become some big paragraphs that I didn't even imagine from the beginning with.  [[condensing process]]
    - The next step is I start to want to condense thoughts, and I'm not sure how I will start with. The reason is I feel that many thoughts that I write is only need some edit, so I don't want to write it again. [[condensing process]]
        - I think about copying them, but they will make unnecessary duplicated in my notes. I think about block reference, but not sure how it works.
        - "The ideal condense thought process:"
            - I can start with freely copy, write, condense them slowly into higher thoughts. It's the same as a daily journal but more focus on the specific topic.
            - The condensing process is now little bit more [[intentional]] or [[goal-driven]], but not too much as [[condensing process]]. This is kind of a [[pressure makes diamond]] process. Before actually using for a [[real life application]].
            - [[condensing process]] will require a little bit of summarizing, key points, key understanding instead of lengthy writing. 
            - The information will be organized in a way that can edit or add-on later, or support [[condensing process]] or support the next [[condensing process]].
            - The structure is easy to edit from multiple thoughts into a structure thought.
            - The old dumping thoughts are still present, so actually copy makes it easier. I only need to use [[Block Reference]] for the one that got condensed already, so I can upgrade it over time.
- Conditions for [[flow]]:
    - 1. Knowing what to do next
    - 2. Knowing how to do it
    - 3. Freedom from distractions
    - 4. Clear and immediate feedback
    - 5. High perceived challenge and high perceived skills
    - Using [[Roam Research]] for [[mind evolution process]] as a flow as an example:
        - 1. Writing and dumping thoughts fearlessly.
        - 2. Read the linked-references and summarize them or continue dumping new thoughts based on that.
        - 3. Work on 1 specific topic or keyword at one time.
        - 4. The feeling of just condensing thoughts
        - 5. The challenge is to gather all of the bits of data into concise knowledge.
- [[nature of human mind]] we think in multi-dimensional and non-structure. The whole point of Roam is to retrieve the right thoughts when needed, and make meaningful connections from that.I
- When reading the communication of [[Roam Research]] founder, it makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable. I feel that he is not have enough openness to really care about people. His idea and his intention is good. His work is good for me as well, and I'm really enjoy what he delivers, but I also feel the frustration of people and how much they want to get heard and be cared. 
    - It makes me really concern about the product. If the voice of users can't be heard, the company will either success by the growth of founder by expertise but it is hard to grow spiritually. 
    - I feel that I will want to support the product that have both in the long-term, it makes me feel more secure to follow that people in the long-run. 
    - I will take a look at amplenote and I will also look carefully at what I really want now. I don't really need features that is not support more need. 
        - Currently, I need a product that can support me to operate and evolve my mind in a natural way.
        - I also want to have the evolving process that feel flow and no friction.
        - I also want to support the person that I can feel count on. 
- [[P: How I use Roam Research to evolve my mind]] [[Roam Research]]
    - [[accumulated interest]] The psychological behind Roam is anytime I write, I feel that I put my thoughts into a bank account and they will not get wasted but get accumulated interest later on. 
    - Another thing is Roam help to [[filter]] the mundane thoughts to retain or condense them into meaningful thoughts, keywords, key concepts, ideas.
    - The other reason is Roam releasing the mind to ineffective tasks. 
        - "Replacing what's your brain do ineffective so you can focus on what's your actual brain should spend [[energy]] on."
            - "Works as a stored node information"
            - "Able to recall exactly all bits of link information and find back unlink information as well."
