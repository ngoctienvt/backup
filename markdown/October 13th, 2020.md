- When I clean inside of myself and feel unstuck, flowing, I feel that I'm not used to this feeling. The feeling of freeing myself, it's not natural to me so I get out of that stage. But I realize that this is very conflict. Because it means that I am not used to what I really want.

It hears funny but it's actually what it really looks like. Khổ quen rồi sướng không chịu được. Even enjoying need to learn because we are so used to our current stage.
 [[enjoy the process]] [[enjoy the rewards]] [[familiarity]]
- I noticed that I have attachments for [[method]] to be effective and not wasting. We will tend to focus on the [[method]] because the cause of it is our inner disturbance, and all we want is to solve it with external solutions as soon as possible.

If we are able to [[establishing the seat of awareness]] inside, we will have no need to focus on the [[method]] and will start to learn to appreciate life, to choose what we want to do in an unattachment manner.

    - The second is I have a tendency to what I don't have instead of appreciating what I already have. It would be better when I start with the appreciation of what already is and then [[complement]] based on that. This will be the shift from [[fear of scarcity]] to [[abundance appreciation]]. [[soul evolution]]
- I am still easy to lose myself to what others do instead of confident and grounded on my own uniqueness. [[establishing the seat of awareness]] This is because of urges and samskaras inside of me still too strong and easily pull me out.
- 
- I felt that the reason I want to have speakers is that I like to be on [[diffuse mode]]. Headphone mainly I want to use for [[focus mode]]. There is a [[separation]] for these 2 ways of living of myself. And now I am starting to learn how to integrate focus mode to my diffuse mode. [[integration]]
- 
- We need to [[unattachment]] with what we unconsciously attach with to [[conscious attachment]] with what we want to attach in an impersonal way.
- [[establishing the seat of awareness]] is not simply as able to come back to that seat when I disconnect with external things, but it's about how to operate from that seat and connect with external world. [[living from the place of surrender]]
- 
    - Ideally, I want to have work to focus on and make the learning experience feel so naturally without the divergence of inner state, but convergence instead. [[convergence focus]] versus [[divergence distraction]]
    - [[convergence focus]] will about I have a thing with [[clear intention]], [[constraint]] and [[top-down approach to focus on in a certain period of times with assurance feeling about [[divergence distraction]] that pull me out.
    - [[divergence distraction]] is also important to work on but the work between [[focus mode]] and [[diffuse mode]], I want to merge them fluidly to each other, so I don't have to make [[conscious choice]] about them.
    - I want to merge my way of living to a flow of water that can harmony with [[flow of life]] instead of always busy making [[conscious choice]]. [[natural progression]] 

A life without the need to think about decisions is about surrendering the need to making [[conscious choice]]. [[living from the place of surrender]]
- On the journey of my life, I'm always moving ahead. And on this journey, there will be people go together with me, there will be people go on their own path, there will be people meet me at a certain period of time and then pass by.

My attention should not be about who will stay, who will leave, who will trust me, and who I have to pull them to go ahead. My attention needs to be about how to make progress on my journey and maybe carry people I meet on the journey if they want. People will come and pass, but my journey is already ahead of me. 

As long as I pay attention to myself and what happens on my journey without the need to what leaves and the resistance to what comes. My life will start to become natural and fluid. [[natural progression]] [[convergence focus]] [[clear intention]]
- I am in the shift from [[familiarity]] to a way of living that surrender my old way to embrace new way continuously. 
    - [[surrender]] means 
        - handle the [[samskaras]] that I'm not handle yet, 
        - let go all of the need for [[familiarity]], 
        - learning to swim in the ocean of the experiences
        - embracing a life that always change, including my identity as a part of it.
        - let go the resistance to the fact that I'm already here with the life of full experiences.
