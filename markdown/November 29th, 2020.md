- I feel that my mind is still unclear and distracting, I don't know what I need to focus on at the moment or what I need to resolve, and how to resolve it now. For example, I need to work on the plane MOC to clear about how I will execute the pilot, but I don't know clearly what I want here, what I need to resolve, and how to relate them to each other. I will need to have a meditation about this.
- I noticed that I get stuck because some of the small things has not process properly yet, and I'm trying to work on the big tasks at once, that's making me feel stress and hard to focus. [[breakdown]]
- I noticed that a big topic can explore different aspects slowly, and don't need to focus to understand clearly at once. Just like a puzzle picture can be fill in slowly, depend of what's unfolding and my interests. [[ðŸŒ²Top-down End-goal]] [[big picture thinking]] [[fill-in strategy]]

Such as a topic about [[getting in touch with reality]] could relate to many things, from deep listening to fully present, from thinking to experiencing, from seeing what's visible to noticing what's invisible.
- My whole interest now is about how to bring the uniqueness inside of myself and other people to serve their [[Dharma duties]], and I need to let go of my personal needs that there are some ways that others need to follow. There is a hidden agenda inside of me feel that other people need to express themselves in a way that fit my tiny wisdom of the world. 

The purpose of life is now, at the moment, not at somewhere that I need to find. Once I can transcend myself to be able to live fully at the moment, life will truly reveal itself to me. And most of the time, I can only support the people who cross my path or come to my path - or to be more exact, people who have a relation with me.
    - I somehow have an arrogance inside of me that I'm the one who knows the truth, but actually, this is wrong, I just know a little bit of the truth, and I have absolutely no right to decide how the universe should be unfolded. This is my ego, not my true self. I need to let go of these arrogance thoughts so that I could nurture my own [[humility]].

Thoughts are what I need to let go or transcend continuously, not what I need to trust and sustain it. It needs to serve me, not I need to serve it.
- The importance of [[personal knowledge development]] is the creating your own connections instead of learn from someone else. The connection that you created by yourself will be sustained by you, and evolved by you.
- I need to re-thinking about my concept of [[scheduling]]. It will not be the period of time that I wait other people and waste my time on that period of time. I could just should 
- [[coaching reflection]] Today I learned that it's easier to support people to work on concrete examples first, instead of work on abstract level or too general that makes them feel hard to process. It's very important to connect with clients deeply, especially their way of being - their learning styles, their way of thinking,.. [[client's way of being]]
