If I want to know something, I need to be the one who really check it and [[getting in touch with reality]], not listen to the [[limiting thoughts]] of my mind. [[current working]]
- I also on a transition stage that replacing my old [[habit-formed will]] to a new direction that is more helpful and supportive for my [[spiritual growth]]. [[current working]]
