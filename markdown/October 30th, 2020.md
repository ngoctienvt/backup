- [[üìùMy Coaching Review]] Today I felt that my way of coaching is better because my ability to observe the world is better. I can know what's important to listen, what's not. [[ability to see what's important]]

I also noticed that my coaching is heavily a learning process, instead of problem-solving or achieving goals process. It emphasizes on clear understanding.

- I also noticed that I'm on a stage breaking my mind limit, so that it could not make me trust to the information that it drew from my past experiences. [[limiting thoughts]]. I'm so na√Øve to trust it based on its statically insignificant data. [[Wisdom]]

If I want to know something, I need to be the one who really check it and [[getting in touch with reality]], not listen to the [[limiting thoughts]] of my mind. [[current working]]
- I also on a transition stage that replacing my old [[habit-formed will]] to a new direction that is more helpful and supportive for my [[spiritual growth]]. [[current working]]
- I felt quite hot when meditation but actually I can felt that I become better over time when I'm keep relax and release. I also noticed that at least I want to learn to enjoy [[üå±Unshakable Centering]] over anything else. It's hard, it's challenging, and it requires me to use my own will power to keep myself detach with my mind and my emotions, but I can se that it's a highest thing that I can do for myself, and there is no cost, no time, no loss, just benefits, sustainable benefits. [[sustainable development]] [[true satisfaction]]
- I felt that I hard to treat [[@Nguy·ªÖn M·ªπ Linh]] as everyone else. I still felt have [[worry]] for her so much that I don't want to see her in that situation again. And this is my own lesson that I need to handle, because she will have her own lesson to learn, and my job is stand back, live my life as best as possible so that I can support her when she needed.
