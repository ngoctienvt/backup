- My focus now will be about my [[üå±Coaching Core Competencies]]. 
    - The skill will be focus on is [[üå±Unshakable Centering]], so that I could feel comfortable with accepting the perfect people that in front of me. 
    - What I meant [[perfect]] here is not they are perfect as how I want so that I feel good and not feel disturbed inside. [[perfect]] here means that they are the perfect result of their past experiences, of all the forces that created the universe and they are perfect inside.
    - So learning to enjoy the moment in front of me without the [[personal needs]] to change it so that it will be make me feel good is the most important thing to develop my [[Maintains Presence]]. 

I will be presence myself to interact with them as a whole, not to use them to interact with my inner [[samskaras]].
        - The second coach skills I want to focus is [[Listens Actively]]. It's about make room for clients to express their inner environment and understand their inner situation, instead of listen to give solutions.
        - Without [[Listens Actively]] to understand the clients, how could I support them to navigate through their inner environments, to see them clearly and to empower them to handle their stuffs, so that they can achieve what they truly want. 
        - [[true freedom]] and [[true happiness]] are what everyone want, every goal if I look deeply, it only based on two things [[end goal]]
        - One is the inner samskaras so that we could satisfy its need
            - Two is the inner shakti that feed you with tremendous happiness, joy, peace, and you want to express it outside to raise the external moments up.
- I will focus on learning [[Courses - Effortless Output with Roam]] next week, so that I could learn to use Roam more effectively, and get input to build my [[journaling training]] as well.
- How can I see like as a [[continuous process]] is still what I'm not really clear. I still have the tendency to breakdown life, and not able to fully integrate my way of looking it yet.

- I also noticed that there is a big fear, a big limitation for me to go beyond myself to embrace the wholeness of the world when I think about going [[international]], going beyond my [[Vietnamese]] and drop myself to the ocean of the vast world that are separated unconsciously. [[wholeness]] [[beyond personal-self]]

- [[üìùMy Coaching Review]] Today when I coach for [[@Nguy·ªÖn Th√∫y H·∫±ng]], I felt so much relief and have more trust for myself, because I can see the result of my coaching that truly satisfy my desire for [[sustainable development]] and not just work on the surface. 
    - My [[fear]] about trying to have the good result is shifting to [[trust the process]] by doing what feel right at the moment. I can always improve it later.
    - It's funny to see a [[coaching metaphor]] about the way of [[living without causing harm]] that I used to use before reappear again. Everyone have a hard time following their samskaras and cause them to live a life that make them smaller instead of expand themselves. [[self expanding]]
    - I still have a tendency to give advices though I'm not sure that it will necessary or not. The reason is because I have the [[need for perfect]]. And this need is to serve myself, not the person in front of me. [[perfect]] I want to let go this need for perfect, and embrace [[trust the process]] instead, because no one can plan their future, they grow continuously through experiences and new awareness.
- I felt so good this tonight, just feel so relax and ease inside of me. Because I really can feel that my path is truly [[on the right track]]. There are still many things that I haven't cleaned yet, but they are reducing day by day, and I become more free and even more expand through that process.
- I noticed that I feel like I'm doing wrong things by using an unknown source to help me buy products. The reason is it makes me to save money. I felt that it would be okay if I do it temporarily, but in the long run, I will want to support the authors if I earn so much from them. I will pay it backwards truthfully, and in the long run, I will try to pay it forward, and let go my [[attachment with money]]
