- [[üìùWeekly Review]]
    - Highlights:
        - I start to be able to re-orient my life, my way of seeing the different topics of my life
        - I start to learn to remove the invisible, illusion frame of reference that I naturally adapt into and learn to expand myself into the infinite
        - I start to recognize that there are some tendencies to make transformation inside other people happens, rather than let it happen naturally
            - I start to learn to able lean back more and be supportive, be encourage, inspiring rather than forcing, making things happen.
        - I start to learn more to unattach myself out of myself, and let go the part inside of me that I still attach into
