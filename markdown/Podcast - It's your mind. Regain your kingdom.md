    - There are many stages on evolution, growth, liberation.
        - First is realize you are not your mind, but the one who watch your mind. This is the first awakening.
            - As long as you don't know you're not your mind or your car, you will not get out.
            - You have a mind - a thought-generating machine. The mind can quiet and stop creating thoughts. Just like a lake don't create wave, a vaccum don't suck. 
            - It's a state that thoughts are not created, it's just stop its fuction. 
            - When the mind in a stillness state, you will know you're not your thought.
    - Meeting someone on their car. And you told them to your house. But they can't get out. Car is an instrument, a gift
    - When you sleep, do you hear anything? You said you go to sleep. Where you go? And who go?
        - You go to sleep mean that 
            - you withdraw out of the part of the mind that receiving the information of the world from the senses - [[the receiving mind]]
            - and go to the subconscious mind - [[the suppressing mind]]
                - where dream comes from
                - where you store the things that you don't want to have on conscious mind
                - It's the part of the room that you don't want to look at. If you're willing to look at, there will be no subconscious.
            - Wish-fulfillment dream
                - You want a bicycle and dream having the experience of have a bicycle.
    - You're always conscious, just the matter of what's your conscious of. The exact same you experience the receiving mind and the suppressing mind.
    - Where your dream comes from? Your mind - instead of creating thoughts, it's creating the dream.
    - During the day, your mind does the exact samething it does at night
        - The day, it creates thoughts based on the stimulate of the external world - we should call it day-mare
        - At sleep, it creates dreams - we call them nightmare. It just normally don't receive the information from the external world to influence your suppressing mind.
    - Just because the mind creates social-acceptable things, doesn't mean it is the truth.
    - Not all the thoughts are positive and constructive.
        - Some body tell you will call you at 10 P.M. But now is 10:15 P.M, what your mind do?
