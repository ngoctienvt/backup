- ## Introduction
    - The **first step in learning how to surrender** is to **understand who in there is doing the surrendering.** The world and our thoughts are **so distracting** that it is **difficult to attain clarity of self.** It turns out that the question “Who am I?” is very deep. In this session, we will explore who we are and what our relationship is to our thoughts, emotions, and the outside world. Things may not be as they seem. 
    - **Are you ready to take an objective look within?**

                        - Learning that we are the only subject, the rest are just the objects of consciousness
                            - Your body, your thoughts and your motions is just the object that you can see, but you are not them
                                - [[thought-experiment]] to prove that you are not your body

                        - Learning that we don't look the objects outside, we look the objects inside

                    - We can't find ourselves outside
                        - We - the one who is looking is the one we need to pay attention to.
                        - The spiritual path is not about finding ourselves, it's about coming back to the seat of self.
                    - When we lost ourselves, we need to center back to the seat of awareness by asking 
                        - about ourselves " Who is aware?" 
                        - and then "What are we aware of?"
                - ### Other [[thought-experiment]] to actively experience who we are truly and challenge who we think we are

                - The challenge for comeback to who we are
            - What's the truth? or What's possible?
                - The truth is it could always be nice in there  
                    - the nicest times we used to experience multiply with million, and always stay there and higher.
                    - It's a beautiful place to live, except for something making it not be. A not-well-management house. Just need to clean up.
            - What's the challenge?
                - ### The distraction and the conspiracy theory
                    - Buddha taught that's "Life is suffering"
                        - Because there will be some moments that are not suffering
                        - But most of the times, we will be trick by the conspiracy theory of what we experience, because they are sync up with each other.
                            - the world's coming in
                            - the thought's stimulated
                            - and the emotions are following or even leading
                        - We don't know much about them or the sequences of them, but we are in there struggling and trying to be okay. And everything we do in our life is trying to be okay.
            - What's the solution?
                - Realizing who we are to be the one who do the main work
                    - What is our nature?
                    - What it feels like when sit back and be the awareness?
                - Understanding about what's truly happen and then reverse the process
                    - If it's always be nice in there, then "What's making it's not nice in there?" ?
                    - and then get rid of that reason, it will comeback to its natural state.
                - Spiritual is about not getting distracted out of ourselves by 3 things that we can experiences
                    - The light of awareness instead of shine on the objects of consciousness, it's learning to shine on itself.
                    - The highest path is learning to gradually in the normal circumstances of life, 
                        - let go of what distracting our consciousness
                        - and eventually attain the seat of permanence - establish on the seat of self
                        - and then live our life
        - Overall how we will learn throughout this course
            - First, learning the truth about who we are and what's happening with us
                - Are you willing to let go of who you thought you were?
                - By learning about who we are, and the characteristics of the things we thought we are
                    - We will feeling much more center on who we are looking, not center on what we're looking at.
                    - Understanding about why we don't feel center on ourselves?
                    - Learn to identify with ourselves instead of the things that not ourselves
                        - "When the body die, will we still in there?"
                            - This is the free-of-charge excitng experiment that we will find out the answer when that time comes.
                            - Because it's either we are not there to know, or we will be there to know what happens.
                            - The reason why we have problems with death is that we identify and project our sense of self to the things that not ourselves. And that's why we fear it will be taken away.
            - Second, learning details about 3 things that affect us
            - Third, learning about the predicament and the spiritual path
            - Fourth, what our life will truly happens when we comeback to our healthy state, instead of sick state.
                - "The peace that pass all of understanding".
    - ### Other insights 
        - What is the teaching approach of Michael Singer? [[training method]]
            - Instead of teach directly what is surrendering - which is difficult because we are so identified with who we are not
                - He slowly guidances us through important awaken process so that it will create a natural separation between the perception and the truth.
                    - thought-experiment
                    - shock-therapy
                    - logical explaination
                - Through this process, we will be able to become more detach and center more about who we are, so that's we could see the truth by ourselves.
- ## Summary
    - In this session, Michael explained that the first step in learning how to surrender is to understand and know who you are. So, who are you? In other words, **do you realize that you are the being** who is in there, **aware of your thoughts, emotions, and the outside world**?
    - We learned **you are not what you look at,** but rather, you are **the one who is looking**. This is called your **seat of awareness**. You are always aware, **you are always conscious**—even in deep sleep, you are in there, aware.
    - **The problem** is **we don’t experience life from that place of awareness.** Throughout our lives, **we have been lost** in our outside world—the people, the places, the things, and the experiences—as well as in our thoughts and emotions, **all in an attempt to make ourselves be and feel OK.** When we **learn to center back** into the seat of awareness, **we will find ourselves, and we can begin the path of surrender.**
- ## Reflecting questions
    - Were you able to relate to Michael when he spoke about hearing the voice talking inside his head as he sat on the couch with his friend? If so, describe what it’s like to just notice your mind is talking.
    - If you are aware that you are in there, what’s it like in there? For example, is it a nice place to be, or is it a messy place to be? What does it feel like on a day-to-day basis? Would you actually allow someone else to see what’s going on in there?
    - Michael explained that awareness is the subject, and the things you experience outside, including your own mind and heart, are simply objects you are aware of. Can you relate to your heart and mind being something you are simply aware of? Describe your experience of what it is like being able to keep your distance, versus getting drawn into them.
    - As we learned in Session One, the first step to surrender is to notice you are in there. If you were able to pull back from behind the world of experience, thoughts, and emotions, were you able to catch a brief glimpse of how beautiful you truly are? What did it feel like?
    - Do you or do you not want to know what is beyond you?
