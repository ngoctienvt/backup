- It seems that I still have some self-conflicts and not sure about my work. I still have not be able to fully put faith on what I work on. It would be better if I can fully devote myself to the path that I'm walking on without any concerns and worriness. It didn't matter that the form taking place will change over time, what matter is the progression. As the form taking place, it will be work to refine continuously. And even the final form is completed, I can always re-do the whole thing if the progression is continuously. 
    - It a big lesson to fully put faith into progression and let things unfold and interact with them fully.
        - This will help me tremendously to connect with now and let go of things that will distract or draw me out of now moments.
    - For instance, if the path taking place in front of me is about utilizing coaching as a tool for spiritual awakening and enlightening. [[Coaching as tools for spiritual growth]]
        - It's important for me to use it to help people working on their roots as deep as possible. Rather than be holding back by what others doing and worrying whether I'm on the right track.
        - There is no right track. There is only unfolding track that require deep involvement, sharp clarity, and continuous progression for creation.
        - If people are using coaching as finding alternatives for their needs, it will be tremendously helpful if I can help them to use coaching as freeing themselves out of these needs and connect with their true self instead.
            - Of course it would still need to be their progression rather than my personal preferences, but at least the path is clear enough for me to help people walk on their true growth.
- I am still have plenty of thoughts that talk to me about what I should do, I don't want to be influence by these thoughts as they are not totally come from me and come from the demand of reality. It's what I think, not what unfolding and calling me into. [[serving the demand of reality]]
    - I will learn to let go all of them and start learn to listen to the unfolding/ the callings as well as inner true inspirations that taking place regardless of my own benefits, just something that want to create or manifest in the reality.
    - I will not do any actions until the emptiness is arising and the voice is absent enough.
- I notice that I still have strong attachments to money. I will learn to free myself out of it, out of the relative change of personal possessions, and will totally unaffected by it. 
- I still have a big disturbance from things that not happen smoothly and may cause trouble for other person or not in my expectations. This will also a big thing that I will need to learn to let go.
    - The way I could learn is doing something that opposite the way I usually react when these things happen and then learn to let go it.
