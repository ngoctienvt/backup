- I noticed that for the next course, it's important to not giving the teaching or theory, it's all about setting the foundations, the path and how things should be. Then everyone will learn how to ensure themselves follow the path, knowing when they are on track and off track, knowing how to direct themselves back and how to move forward the blockages or hard time.
    - It's means that the practices and the know-how will develop mostly by them, I only help them know what's possible or meant to be, and how we can guide ourselves into that direction.
    - The path is about moving up from the lower center of energy that just want to satisfy itself to a higher center energy that are not about me, but about other only.
        - There will be some principles to move up
            - Acceptance - go through with acceptance - use lower center as the stepping stones for reaching the higher stones - not refusing or denying their roles
            - Find out what's meant to be - so that develop the path to it
- I felt that my cleaning is exponential these days. I start to notice clearly when I'm operating based on my lower-self, and I also notice that how little I am in the higher-self, but it starts to nurture and develop. It's not clear yet, but at least the seeds start to grow.
