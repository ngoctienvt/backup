    - Definition about love
        - True love is not about possession, it's about the ability to fully embrace other person as they are now. 
        - True love is not about attachment, it's about we grow enough to offer true freedom to each other, and in that freedom, we share our love fully.
        - True love is beyond desire and fear, it's about the harmony, the embracing, the connection deeply between people without being disturb by personal desires and fears.
    - Samskaras with family
        - I notice that I still have fear when I'm being scolded, given direction... I noticed that I have a strong defense need in front of my family. I will need to learn to remove these needs to defense and able to welcome them as they are first.
