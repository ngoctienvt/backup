- [[ðŸŒ±My Coaching Reflection]] As today, I can feel that the coaching is effective due to the fact that I didn't start with what clients want to discuss, but rather explore to understand deeply first.
    - However, there are some moments that I feel I still explain too much instead of concise [[reflection]] and support clients to formulate their own [[understanding]].
    - I felt that I still in charge too much unnecessary. In fact, I want to support them to work on their own first, and only have some [[stand back support]] to help them facilitate their development. [[silence]]
- I noticed that I have a big desire to support other people to become better and that makes me want to share I know, what I find out to support them. But sometimes I focus too much on the process of sharing and forget the [[end goal]] are not sharing, but how helpful they are with them and how they can utilize it to become better. [[helpful manner]]
- Today, I started to learn to [[enjoy the process]] while I focus at the same time. It's the being while doing or being to do.
- I still feel a little mess to focus to working on [[condensing and generative process]]. I need to be able to create a flow to condense things in a natural way. Now still a little bit too forcing and the mind still scatter in the process as it's not sure what it needs to do.
